To this day, vaccines are estimated to save millions of lives a year. More than 90 percent of U.S. children get common childhood vaccinations, such as polio or their measles, mumps, and rubella shot, but most adults fail to get their full complement of recommended adult vaccinations. Assuming you got all your childhood vaccinations, and aside from any emergent pandemic needs, the CDC recommends all healthy adults get annual flu shots, tetanus boosters every ten years, though the World Health Organization doesn't think this is necessary, shingles vaccination at age 50, and pneumonia vaccine at age 65. Certain groups need others, such as a hepatitis B series for healthcare workers or men who have sex with men. Ask your medical professional for a personalized schedule. How safe are vaccines? In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the RAND Corporation screened more than 50,000 citations and concluded that routine vaccinations can be considered safe, with only rare serious adverse effects, such as severe allergic reactions, in 1 to 10 in a million, and transient autoimmune syndromes Guillain-Barré and immune thrombocytopenic purpura in 1 to 3 in a million, and 10 to 30 in a million for flu shots and MMR vaccines, respectively. Of course, any adverse effects should be weighed against any protective effects that vaccines may provide. In my last video, I talked about the effectiveness of flu vaccines. What about pneumonia vaccines? ""Pneumonia may well be called the friend of the aged,"" wrote the ""Father of Modern Medicine,"" Sir William Osler, over a hundred years ago in 1898. ""Taken off by it in an acute, short, not often painful illness, the old man escapes those 'cold gradations of decay' so distressing to himself and to his friends."" The thought was that pneumonia mercifully killed those who would soon die anyway from potentially a more protracted, painful illness. But, these days, healthy older adults hospitalized for pneumonia are not significantly more likely to die in the subsequent two years than younger adults in the same situation. Because of comorbidities at older ages, though, pneumonia is the fourth leading cause of death in the world and the ninth leading cause in the United States. The most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, as opposed to hospital-acquired, is a bacteria known as pneumococcus, or Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition to pneumonia, pneumococcus can cause inner ear infections, sinusitis, or pinkeye. It gets serious when it starts to invade the bloodstream, which can result in meningitis, infection of the brain; endocarditis, infection of the heart valves; or sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by blood poisoning. Thankfully, we have vaccines against pneumococcus. The first was developed over a century ago, but they fell out of favor after penicillin was discovered, thinking antibiotics would eliminate the threat. Unfortunately, these days up to 40 percent of these kind of streptococcal infections are resistant to at least one antibiotic, and despite our miracle drugs, mortality rates of invasive pneumococcus in the elderly remain around 15 to 30 percent. However, randomized controlled trials have found that pneumococcus vaccines reduce the risk of those 65 and older getting pneumococcal pneumonia by 64 percent, and, even more importantly, your risk of invasive pneumococcal disease by 73 percent. Like the flu vaccine, population studies have found that pneumonia vaccines can reduce the risk of both heart attacks and the overall risk of dying, but unlike flu vaccines, there aren't randomized controlled trials to confirm these bonus benefits."

""Benefits and Side Effects of the Flu Vaccine"" Every year, influenza typically kills between 4,000 and 20,000 Americans, though the death toll for the 2017 to 2018 season was estimated at 80,000, making it one of the deadliest in the last half century. Most hospitalizations and 90 percent of flu-related mortality occur in those 65 and older, and most over the age of 75. Mortality rates for the flu at ages 75 and older are 50 times higher than those below age 65. Nonetheless, the CDC recommends everyone over the age of 6 months get a routine annual flu shot every year, if for no other reason than to help prevent transmission to the more vulnerable. The cruel irony is that older adults, the ones who need protection the most, acquire less robust protection from flu shots due to waning immunity with age. Depending on the season, vaccination typically reduces the risk of getting the flu by about 40 to 50 percent. So, in healthy adults, we can say with moderate certainty we can decrease the risk of getting it from like 2 percent each year down to just under 1 percent. Among older adults, even if you get a similar relative risk reduction, from 6 percent down to 2.4 percent, since the risk is higher and the consequences greater, the absolute benefits are greater too. In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season can start as early as September and go as late as March. The problem with getting vaccinated too early in the season is that immunity might wane before the season is over, especially in older adults. So, it might be good to wait until October, but getting it at any time throughout the season is preferable to not getting vaccinated at all. Yes, the influenza vaccine can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune attack on your nerves that can leave you paralyzed for weeks, but so too can getting the flu. There may be 1 to 2 additional cases of Guillain-Barré per million vaccinations versus about 17 extra cases per million contacts with the flu virus. So, you're much more likely to be temporarily paralyzed by the flu than the flu shot, but since it takes vaccinating about 30 older people to prevent one case of the flu, getting vaccinated would still, in expectation, raise your overall Guillain-Barré risk. But the reason flu shots are recommended is not to lower risk of some obscure autoimmune syndrome but to reduce the common, and potentially devastating, impacts of the flu that extend well beyond just the respiratory infection. In the week following a confirmed flu infection, the risk of having a heart attack shoots up six-fold. The inflammation of infection can destabilize atherosclerotic plaques, constrict arteries, and make the blood more liable to clot. So, might flu vaccinations save lives in more ways than one? That's why indirectly the flu may kill up to three times more. Those who get their flu shots are indeed less likely to die from cardiovascular disease in a given year as well as all causes put together. In other words, those who get regular flu shots live, on average, longer lives. But who disproportionally gets flu shots? White, married, nonsmokers of a higher social class, with higher education, higher incomes, and health insurance. You can't tell if it's truly cause-and-effect until you put it to the test. There have been four randomized controlled trials, flu shots versus placebo shots, in those with pre-existing heart disease, and overall, those who got the real shots had a 56 percent lower chance of dying from cardiovascular disease and a 47 percent lower chance of dying from all causes put together. So, flu shots really can be an extraordinary life-saver. Whether the observational data showing fewer deaths across the board, even among those without pre-existing heart disease, similarly pans out is, as of yet, unknown, but if you notice for secondary prevention the randomized controlled trials showed even more protection than the observational studies hinted at. Given the benefits, overcoming vaccine hesitancy should be as simple as correcting misinformation, but sadly, debunking vaccine myths may actually backfire. Busting the myth that inactivated flu shots, the type given to older adults, can give you the flu surprisingly makes people even less likely to get it. Similarly, correcting the falsehood that MMR vaccines cause autism or that pertussis vaccination causes as many side effects as people think paradoxically makes people less inclined to vaccinate. The researchers conclude ""correcting vaccine myths may not be an effective approach to promoting vaccination."""

What does it have to say about using a common household product on warts? ""Removing Warts with Duct Tape"" When I was reviewing the science behind common over-the-counter remedies used in dermatology such as tea tree oil for acne or nail fungus, I was surprised to see on the same page a section on duct tape. Duct tape?! The only time I remember seeing duct tape used in a medical study was on the identification of the gases responsible for the odor of human farts, which involved a collection system comprised of gas-tight pantaloons sealed to the skin with duct tape. That's the study where they assessed the wind breaking ability of a cushion called the Toot Trapper. But what the dermatology journal was talking about is warts. Duct tape brings out our inventive, slightly kooky side. Given this versatility, it wasn't so surprising a few years ago when a group of doctors reported that duct tape could get rid of warts. As I noted in my last wart video, all sorts of strange things are purported to cure warts because most go away on their own. A thousand kids were followed for two years and two-thirds of the warts disappeared without doing a thing. So maybe we should just leave them alone, although there are cases that may warrant treatment. Otherwise we can just let our own body take care of them. Warts are caused by wart viruses, and so spontaneous wart disappearance is assumed to be an immune response where our body finally wakes up and takes notice. This assumption is based on studies like this—where foreign proteins were injected into the wart itself, like a measles-mumps- rubella vaccine straight into the wart— which compared to placebo, appeared to accelerate the immune clearance process. The problem, of course, is that injections hurt, and 30% of the kids that got their warts injected with the vaccine suffered a flu-like syndrome. Yikes! OK, scratch that. What else do we got? Within a few months any placebo treatment will work in about a quarter of the cases. So if you put duct tape on 100 warts and 23 go away, that wouldn't mean much. The traditional medical therapies, acid treatments and freezing treatments, bump the cure rate up to about 50%. So if you were really serious about testing the efficacy of duct tape, you would pit it head to head against one of those, and that's exactly what happened. The efficacy of duct tape vs cryotherapy in the treatment of the common wart. Cryotherapy is one of the treatments of choice for many pediatricians. Objective: To determine if application of duct tape is as effective as cryotherapy in the treatment of common warts. Patients were randomized to receive either liquid nitrogen applied to each wart or duct tape occlusion. When I heard about treating warts with duct tape, I had this image where they were like trying to rip them off or something. No, no, no, no. They're just applying a little circle of duct tape every week or so. Here are the details... Although there had been a few anecdotal reports of using tape, no prospective, randomized controlled trial had yet been performed until this study, which found that the duct tape was not only equal to but exceeded the efficacy of cryotherapy, which worked in 60% of the cases, but 85% of the duct tape patients were cured—significantly more effective than cryotherapy for treatment of the common wart. More effective and fewer side effects. The only adverse effect observed in the duct tape group during our study was a small, minimal amount of local irritation and redness, whereas cryotherapy hurts. You want to hear the saddest thing? One young child actually vomited in fear of pain before each cryotherapy session. They were like torturing the poor kid. Cryotherapy can cause pain and bloody blisters that can get infected and mess up your nail bed. So, duct tape: more effective, fewer side effects and more convenient. Compare applying a little duct tape at home to making multiple clinic visits, dragging the poor kid back every two weeks. I mean it's like a win-win-win. Duct tape can now be offered as a nonthreatening, painless, and inexpensive technique for the treatment of warts in children. I mean how much does a little piece of duct tape cost? It's like a win-win-win-win. Ah, but the money you save is the money the doctor loses. There's no way the medical profession is going to just let this go unchallenged. Further studies were performed and failed to show an effect, and so we end up in the medical literature with conclusions like this: ""Is duct tape effective for treating warts?"" Bottom line? No. Huh. Is duct tape really not effective after all, or was there some kind of critical design flaw in the follow-up studies? We'll find out next. One of the unusual, innovative, and long-forgotten remedies noted in this dermatology journal was the use of duct tape to cure warts, finally put to the test. There's all sorts of conventional therapies from acid to cryosurgery to lasers, but most of these are expensive, or painful, or both. Whereas the simple application of duct tape is neither— and may even be more effective than trying to freeze the warts off. Some doctors lauded the study, noting they had been using duct tape for decades as a painless yet effective treatment, as opposed to surgery and other destructive therapies. The only downside being your patients may think you're off your rocker, but hey, when it works, they appreciate your wise choice to minimize discomfort. Other doctors were not so amused. Here they are spending money on all this fancy equipment and then along comes duct tape? Studies like that ""could damage the reputation of cryosurgery,"" complaining that the 10-second application of liquid nitrogen they used in the study was too short, so it was an unfair comparison. And evidently you really have to get in there and freeze until they get a blistering reaction. And yes, it hurts but too bad, even making light of the poor child who vomited out of fear of the pain prior to each freezing by making some joke about it. Did they have a point, though, about the 10 seconds? Well, in the duct tape versus cryotherapy trial those 10-second cryotherapy treatments worked 60% of the time, which is actually better than the results of most cryotherapy studies that only seemed to cure about 50%. In fact, the typical cryotherapy for warts works so poorly that statistically it didn't even beat out placebo, so all that pain may be for nothing, though aggressive cryotherapy does seem to work better. See, what they should have done, wrote another doctor in response to the duct tape trial, is take a scalpel to it and then really blister it up, and then you go back a week later and try to cut and crater it out, and then maybe go back a third time, bragging that they can get closer to a 90% cure rate. Yeah, but at what cost? In the duct tape trial one patient lost his study wart in a trampoline toe-amputation accident. Hey, there's a treatment that works, 100% effective: amputation! But at what cost? Eighty-five percent of the duct tape patients were cured with no pain or tissue damage, whereas aggressive cryotherapy may require lidocaine injection, nerve blocks, to take the ""cry out of cryotherapy"" and can cause permanent tissue damage. You can end up with these big necrotic frostbite lesions. I mean in one sense tissue damage is the whole point of freezing warts, but you can end up causing these deep burns or end up rupturing tendons, which can cause permanent disability or cause extensive scarring in rare cases. Just the psychological stress of having to keep going back for this painful procedure may ironically impair our ability to fight off the wart viruses in the first place. And so even if the effectiveness of duct tape is shown to be merely equivalent to that of cryotherapy, it would be better; and it was shown to be even more effective, in fact maybe most effective. Compared to 10 other wart treatments, duct tape beat out them all in terms of effectiveness, and also in terms of cost— cheaper than all but the DN option, which stands for Do Nothing. Compared to the most cost-effective prescription treatments available, OTC duct tape, meaning over-the-counter duct tape, is 10 times cheaper. It's an unusual and welcome event in health care when a common ailment is proven equally amenable to an inexpensive, tolerable, and safe alternative therapy. But wait. If you look at the latest Cochrane review, which is like the gold-standard of evidence-based reviews, they acknowledge that cryotherapy is less convenient, more painful, more expensive. But while in the earlier review they did get excited about the effectiveness of duct tape, in two subsequent studies duct tape seemed to totally flop. So should we give up on duct tape for warts or is there another side of the story? We'll find out in the thrilling conclusion next."

They need answers based on facts. In other words, in the peer-reviewed medical literature, and that is what I’m here for. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today we discover that anatomy may not be destiny. It turns out that in some countries 85% of menopausal women suffer hot flashes. But in other countries that number's only 15%. Here’s our first story. SWAN, which stands for Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation, is by far the largest evaluation of menopausal symptoms in history, studying 16,000 American women between the ages of 40 and 55. They found that women over a body mass index of 27 or higher were significantly more likely to suffer from hot flashes or night sweats, stiffness or soreness, and urinary leakage. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; 30 is obese; and the average U.S. BMI is 29.8. Since fatty tissue is a source for estrogen one might expect the reverse, but the link between excess body fat and worse menopausal symptoms indeed seems causal since women randomized to a weight loss intervention experience significant improvement in hot flashes, an effect that may extend to bariatric surgery. In the SWAN study, smoking and inactivity were also associated with more frequent symptoms. It’s always a good idea to quit smoking and exercise, but there are no interventional trials on smoking cessation and menopausal symptoms to prove cause-and-effect, and randomized controlled trials of exercise failed to show any symptom relief. Of course you could just take hormone therapy, but at the cost of significantly higher risk of suffering a heart attack, stroke, blood clot, breast cancer, or gallbladder disease. What can we do naturally to avoid the extra clots and cancer? Hot flashes, also referred to as hot flushes, are the most common menopausal symptom for which women seek treatment. They afflict up to 80 to 85 percent of European and American women, lasting, along with night sweats, for an average of more than seven years. But these symptoms are not universal. Though in North America they may be considered inevitable, if you noticed in Japan, for example, only 15 percent may be affected. In fact, there isn’t even a term for hot flash in the Japanese language. The absence of even a word for it in Japan is all the more remarkable because Japanese is said to be “infinitely more sensitive” than English in describing bodily states, with all sorts of extremely subtle distinctions for somatic sensations. For example, there are all sorts of specific terms describing different sensations. In Japanese there are 20 or more words just to describe the state of one's stomach and intestines alone. But hot flashes appear to be so unusual there, researchers had to come up with ways to describe it in Japanese surveys. Investigators suspected it might be the soy. Dietary surveys have estimated that soy isoflavone intake, the phytoestrogens in soy, is at least ten times higher than in Europe or North America. And one comparison of urine metabolites revealed Japanese women have a hundred times more phytoestrogens flowing through their body at any one time. To see if this might be playing a role, researchers followed a thousand Japanese women over time, starting before they reached menopause, to see if soy consumption was linked to whether or not they developed hot flashes. Women eating around four ounces of tofu a day only had half the risk compared to women only eating an ounce or two a day. The researchers concluded, “Our findings suggest that consumption of soy products is a practical strategy for preventing hot flashes.” But only if interventional trials prove they actually work, which I’ll cover next. Is the consumption of soy the reason why there isn’t even a word for hot flash in Japanese? Approximately 80% of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women surveyed choose to try natural means to deal with symptoms, and the single most common approach was soy. But does it work? Outside of an Asian context, soy milk may be a greater source of isoflavones than soy foods, and that seems ready-made for a randomized trial against dairy milk or another plant milk control. Soy milk consumption has been associated with fewer hot flashes and night sweats and skim milk with worse menopausal symptoms, but when actually put to the test against each other there does not appear to be any difference. There have been studies showing that randomizing women to soy milk can reduce hot flashes and vaginal symptoms as much as 70% compared to the control group, but without a placebo control, we’re not sure how much of that is the placebo effect. To truly blind study subjects, soy isoflavones were extracted out and stuffed into capsules to be pitted against identical looking “sugar pill” placebo capsules. More than a dozen such clinical studies have been performed— randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials —and indeed, the equivalent of about two servings of soy foods a day worth reduced hot flash frequency by about 20% more than placebo and hot flash severity by around 25% more than placebo, compared to more like  a 30 to 40% net reduction from estrogen hormone therapy. Soy isoflavones have also been shown to improve other menopausal concerns including vaginal dryness, bone loss, memory and cognitive functions more generally, as well as depression. There have been a few trials in which soy was pitted head-to-head against hormone therapy. One found their efficacy comparable, in terms of reducing hot flashes, muscle and joint pain, and vaginal dryness. In the other, hormones worked twice as well, a 54% reduction in hot flash scores taking the standard estrogen/progesterone combination compared to 24% over placebo in the soy isoflavone group. Not only did the hormones work better, but they can work quicker. Three months are required for soy isoflavones to achieve half their maximal effect, whereas the same is achieved after just three weeks with estrogen. Of course, soy has the benefit of no increased risk of cancer and clots. In fact, if anything, a reduction in breast cancer risk throughout the lifespan, and lower risk of cardiovascular disease. The bottom line, wrote one consensus panel of experts, is that soy can be considered a first-line treatment for menopausal hot flash and night sweat symptoms. One convenient whole food source of soy is soy nuts, which are dry roasted soybeans. Harvard Medical School’s Center of Excellence in Women’s Health funded a randomized crossover study of a half cup of unsalted soy nuts a day (divided into three or four portions and spaced throughout the day) and achieved a 50% reduction in hot flashes within two weeks. What’s inconvenient about soy nuts is the formation of advanced glycation end products in the roasting process, though about four times less than that of roasted real nuts, or other roasted legumes, and ten times less than a serving of something like roasted chicken, but something like edamame or canned soybeans would be better. Some menopausal women use isoflavone supplements, but most just add soy foods to their diet. I think that’s the way to go. Supplement mislabeling and contamination issues aside, though isolated isoflavones have been shown to improve artery function and decrease high blood pressure. Soy foods can also lower LDL cholesterol which may explain the lower associated cardiovascular disease risk. Besides the lower breast cancer risk, soy eaters are also less likely to get prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. What if you combined a plant-based diet and soybeans? Two randomized controlled trials found that reduced-fat plant-based diets with a daily half cup serving of cooked whole soybeans can reduce the number of serious hot flashes by 84 to 88% within twelve weeks. Overall, most randomized to the plant-based group ended up free of moderate- to-severe hot flashes, compared to about 95% still suffering in the control group.

About a quarter of Americans over the age of 50 suffer from olfactory dysfunction, a difficulty identifying odors, which climbs to more than half of individuals between the ages of 65 to 80, and about 80 percent in those over the age of 80. And that was before COVID-19, which affected the smell of nearly 50 percent of sufferers. Typically, it was temporary, but as many as a 15 percent of non-hospitalized COVID survivors were still experiencing problems with the ability to smell three or more months later, and there are cases of it lasting for years. As anyone with even a simple head cold can tell you, when you lose your sense of smell, you lose much of your sense of taste as well. Between 75 to 95 percent of what we think of as taste, may actually be smell. This was all too vividly illustrated by the case of Algerian War soldiers whose tongues were cut out, remarkably reporting little loss of food and drink flavor sensation. But hey, if loss of smell leads to loss of taste, think of all the weight loss! That was apparently the thought behind the development of a ""novel nasal device,"" gag-inducing silicone tubes you stick into your nostrils to cordon off your smell receptors. Researchers recorded a drop in preference for sugary foods and beverages along with weight loss, but only among the younger adults, presumably because the sense of smell of the older adults was already impaired. Making everything taste bland may help you skip a few doughnuts, but the flipside is that people with smelling difficulties tend to add more salt. Older individuals were found to require two to three times more salt than those who were younger to achieve the same salty taste. It's no wonder that the lifetime risk of developing high blood pressure may exceed 90 percent. What can we do to preserve our sense of smell? Ambient air pollution is associated with olfactory dysfunction, thought to explain why nasal biopsies from residents of Mexico City, living and dead, showed more lesions and inflammatory changes than those living in low-pollution cities. We may not have a choice where we live, but there is definitely a direct source of air pollution tied to loss of smell we can all choose to avoid: cigarette smoke. Smell loss can have serious consequences, for example, missing a gas leak, smoke, or spoiled food. If you have lost your sense of smell and use natural gas, please consider buying a gas detector. But, in terms of direct disability, most people who are affected don't even to seem to be aware their smell is impaired, even when asked directly. Nearly 8 out of 10 elderly individuals with smell loss thought they had normal smell sensitivity. Hearing loss, however, is considered a major cause of global disability, ranking among the top chronic conditions affecting older adults. For far too long, though, as a National Academy of Medicine report put it, hearing loss has been ""relegated to the sidelines of health care."" For those interested, check out my video series that starts with Age-Related Hearing Loss Is Preventable, then a supplement shown to help, and ending with a video on dietary changes that can help, too."

It's caused by the deterioration of the optic nerve that connects the eye to the brain. Most commonly this is due to excessive pressure inside the eyeball. Ginkgo biloba is one of the most common supplements taken by glaucoma sufferers. It doesn't seem to lower intraocular pressure, but MRI studies suggest ginkgo supplements may increase cerebral blood flow in the brain. What about blood flow to the eyes? Ginkgo increases ocular blood flow in both normal and glaucomatous subjects; so, it was put to the test. Compared to sugar pills, 40 milligrams of a ginkgo extract twice a day, on top of their regular anti-glaucoma medications, appeared to significantly slow the progression of visual defects in open-angle glaucoma patients, the most common type, though it's not clear in this study if the participants were properly randomized. Aside from a single published case report of visual improvements after ginkgo supplementation, there don't appear to be any other studies on open-angle glaucoma, but there have been two interventional trials on the less common normal tension type. They were both randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials using the same dose and duration. One found a significant benefit, an improvement in pre-existing visual field damage, but the other found no benefit at all. If you want to try it despite the underwhelming results, make sure to first discuss with your healthcare professional due to a possible increase in bleeding risk from the herb. Any other supplement possibilities? In 2017, extraordinary results were reported in a leading scientific journal. Nicotinamide, a form of vitamin B3, was able to prevent the development of glaucoma in aged mice prone to the disease, with more than 90 percent effectiveness. Moderate or severe nerve damage was found in about two-thirds of the control mice, but 93 percent of the mice given nicotinamide had none. The researchers concluded, ""The degree of protection afforded by administering this single molecule is unprecedented and unanticipated."" A commentary on the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine entitled, ""Nicking Glaucoma with Nicotinamide?"" suggested clinical trials should be initiated. The researchers thought to give it a try based on the fact that glaucomatous mice had a comparable deficiency in NAD+, from which nicotinamide is a precursor. Is that even the case in people? Apparently so. Those with glaucoma have about a third lower nicotinamide levels in their blood compared to age-matched peers. And greater intake of niacin, which is another form of B3, is associated with less glaucoma. It was time to put it to the test, and the title gives it away. In 2020, an international team of researchers published a study in which glaucoma patients were randomized to nicotinamide or placebo for 12 weeks and then switched for another 12 weeks. And significantly fewer patients suffered further visual field deterioration while on the nicotinamide, 4 percent versus 12 percent while on placebo. A 2022 study found significant improvements in visual function compared to placebo within two months, but it's not directly comparable, since they also added pyruvate, which is another component of energy metabolism. For a discussion of cost, labeling confusion, and potential side effects of taking nicotinamide, check out the NAD chapter in my book How Not to Age, in which I go through the pros and cons of all nine NAD-boosting supplements, it's like a tongue twister: NA, NAM, NMN, NR, NAD, NADH, NMNH, NRH, tryptophan.

Does use of alternative medicine in addition to conventional therapies predict prolonged survival from cancer? Even if the alternative therapies themselves were useless, one might predict users would live longer, because they tend to have more hope, a greater will to live, nearly three times as likely to believe their cancer was curable even if it wasn't. But death rates were actually higher in alternative medicine users. Follow them up years later and 79% of the alternative medicine users had died compared to 65% of nonusers. Now if the alternative medicine users started out sicker that could certainly explain it, and they did tend to be, though the difference didn't reach statistical significance. Bottom-line: the association between the use of alternative medicine and shortened survival is not necessarily cause and effect, but it's possible some of the alternative modalities may have indeed been harmful. Thanks to the internet, there's been a resurgence of older complementary and alternative cancer treatments, such as laetrile, which is a compound derived from amygdalin, a natural cyanide-containing substance concentrated in apricot kernels, the seeds inside the pits. It was branded as a ""vitamin"" to skirt regulations—vitamin B-17— but it's not a vitamin, and a lack of laetrile's effectiveness against cancer and the risk of side effects from cyanide poisoning led to its being banned decades ago. However, no surprise, you can still buy it on the internet along with the apricot kernels themselves. Why not just give them a try though? Because of cyanide intoxication. Here's a typical case report. Woman ate some apricot seeds she got at a health food store, so they've got to be healthy, right? Twenty minutes later she was having trouble breathing, before she slipped into a coma. They made some calculations and it appears an 8-ounce bag of apricot kernels is enough to kill six people if consumed in one sitting. Therefore, the continuing sale of apricot kernels as health food is troubling. And you never know what you're getting. Here this person was consuming a quarter of a teaspoon of ground apricot kernels daily and had just switched brands the day before. She ended up in the ICU. Thankfully she survived; others are not so lucky, like this 17-year-old who was dead within a day, as severe cyanide poisoning can result in coma, convulsions and cardiovascular collapse. That's why calling it a vitamin is so insidious. A 32-year-old woman arrives at an emergency room in a coma. Was she on anything? No, she just took some vitamin supplements. Thankfully a relative showed up with them. Oh, B-17. They gave her a cyanide antidote and she survived. But had that relative not showed up or been delayed in traffic or something, the case could have proved fatal. So cancer patients should be informed about the high risk of developing serious adverse effects due to cyanide poisoning after laetrile or amygdalin, the natural compound in apricot seeds. Especially at risk may be those taking megadoses of vitamin C or those not getting enough vitamin B12. See, the body has two major ways to detoxify cyanide. It can attach it to B12 to form the supplement form cyanocobalamin, which can then be harmlessly peed out. Or it can use the amino acid cysteine, which is also used to metabolize vitamin C. And so if you take too much vitamin C, levels can drop, and you can end up more vulnerable to cyanide toxicity. But hey, conventional cancer treatments such as chemo can be toxic, too. It's all about benefits versus risks. Yeah, amygdalin can block the growth of certain cancer cells in a petri dish, though doesn't appear to have any anti-cancer effects against laboratory animal tumors. But you don't know what happens in people until you put it to the test and do a clinical trial of amygdalin in the treatment of human cancer, which we'll cover next."

treadmill my stationary treadmill because so many people uh complain that I was making people seasick I don't want to make people sick that's kind of the antithesis of what I'm trying to do let's get to your questions first one up is nutritionally for weight loss longevity to peanuts are they more like nuts or legums and which nuts seeds have the highest concentration of plant sterols to bring down LDL um so nutritionally um peanuts are very similar to tree nuts um and and so for in terms of weight loss very similar kind of uh chloric density um and in terms of longevity walnuts really beat all other tree nuts as well as peanuts um and I don't think uh uh peanut butter works at all um and then in terms of that's a good question about plant steril plant steril are part of Dr David Jenkins portfolio diet the most effective diet for dropping LDL cholesterol um to date which is a plant-based diet with specific foods that pull down cholesterol including a plant sterol rich foods I don't know which ones have more than others good question all right oh I gotta scroll all the way back up um uh uh let's see uh um let's see what else we have here have I ever looked into modified Citrus pectins I have not I assume that's some kind of food additive the silica uh prevent uh ages no I uh I mean I no not that I know of nor would a boost Cen I do have a webinar on collagen boosting Foods check it out are eating bamboo shoots in non oil mix satang uh there's another silica question no but eting silica does not boost the colagen formation far as I know should the government tax High saturated fat uh Foods um whether it should or whether it could different so there was a I do have videos talking about the Danish meat tax um so effective that the animal agriculture Lobby made sure it did not last very long but just as we were starting to see significant Public Health public health benefits really unfortunately um any tips on repopulating my gut after a course of antibiotics um well um probiotics taking probiotic subance actually makes things worse actually delays the rebalancing of your gut floor which is something that I discovered in researching how not to age I check out my ProBox chapter um all we can do is just start feeding uh I mean there's certain um antibotics are absorbing in small intestin don't really affect much the gut um but um but if if you're experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms make sure get lots of prebiotics to feed the stragglers you know we're not sterilizing the gut you just may your gut microbes may take a hit so you feed them lots of good food and they are uh will be uh fruitful and multiply on their own all right are there any health benefits you can get from coffee but not from green tea absolutely so coffee has chlorogenic acid the autophagy boosting um antioxidant um green tea does not three cups of coffee a day decrease all cause mortality by 133% Three Cups of Tea a day 24% but by a different mechanism actually ironically a prooxidant mechanism um rallying our antioxidant effectes antioxidant defenses in a interesting that which doesn't kill us make a stronger hormetic mechanism anyway they both work from different uh mechanisms so we' assume it would be an additive effect um and so eat both or drink both so I started out with c now I'm drinking tea which is what I recommend people do all right next up could I name all the could I name all the things I can do again seasonal hay fever typ go to nutritionfacts.org type in hay fever and all the or seasonal allies and all the videos will come up I believe green tea was one of them but um I don't remember offand otherwise I would tell you next up any advice to help with sleep absolutely not just falling asleep but staying asleep absolutely um so treating insomni is all about sleep hygiene sleep conditioning and I have uh I think I've talked about five roles of each in uh the Sleep uh chapter of how not to Ag and I think sleep chapter of how not to Diet also has the same information um also um warm baths um either foot baths or full body baths or showers U before going to bed even just warming wearing warm socks at night um improve uh improve sleep and through an interesting mechanism which I talk about how not to check it out go to your local public library check it out okay next up I've taken amla amla is dried Indian Gooseberry powder and it lowered cholesterol levels by about 10% okay um that's great um what if there was one thing to lower high blood pressure what would it be uh hibiscus tea probably or ground flax seed would be my two Best Bets but uh um less than a teaspoon a day of ground black sesame seeds also drops systolic blood pressure by about eight points if sustained that alone could decrease your risk of Stroke by about a quarter how exciting is that okay r Phil Hampton says what are my thoughts oh eonia I talk about eonia kill high levels of strup tonus um oh so I talk about eonia being useless in terms of um upper rest tra infections I've not heard of of anything about gup strect tockus um and eonia but uh if it's being I don't know I I mean the the the thing that was most uh we thought we had the greatest evidence based for was upper rest Tech infections in fact and turns out it doesn't even work for that that I can't tell you Bonnie says how much fat to have each meal to get sufficient nutrition any pH before oh yeah oh so what this questioner what Bonnie is asking is talking about the absorption of fat soluble nutrients so if you eat a meal without any fat in it so if youat like a salad with no nuts seed or avocado with a fat free dressing you are not going to maximally absorb all the fat soluble um Fon nutrients like all those carotenoid nutrients are so beneficial like the beta carotene the greens Etc um so uh it does not take much I have a video about that and I give exact values but it was just a few I forget like a few walnuts or quarter of an avocado if I remember but check out that video but yeah it does not take much um and yeah um soybeans certainly chickpeas are low in fat low in fat but uh um soybeans may have enough um uh fat um but you know you got to sprinkle you know flax seeds onto your food anyway ground flax seeds is probably my daily dozen um so that's another great way to uh make sure you just have just enough fat to uh boost the absorption of your fat soluble nutrients how do you pressure cook beans without adding oil I never heard of I've never heard of um adding oil at all uh well maybe I did not read my instanton instructions but um I've never you I've cooked beans I was gonna say all my life not all my life but for years um since I got my first instant pot or any you know electronic pressure cooker you don't need to add oil I've never added oil I've never had a clogging of the vent pipe maybe I just got a lucky sarcoma oh saroma with per vertebral Invasion just got diagnosed with that that's not good um so saroma is a cancer of kind of connective tissues um oh that's a fantastic question so what can I actually do um that is the subject of what I hope is GNA be my next book if the publisher agrees um book on cancer so I'll be doing daily cancer protocols for all 16 or so cancers um that kill 5,000 Americans or more um although saroma may not actually make the list but fingers crossed so I just don't know but there certainly are foods that can improve survival for different types of cancer different foods for different cancers um but it's saroma is not one I've looked into and may not look into for the book I don't think that actually made the list I think 16th was melanoma um so uh cancer is more rare than that killing fewer Americans than that will not make the list unfortunately already it's going to be a massive book with a daily dozen um I get all my vitamin needs except for one only get 300 milligrams Coline versus the Rd 550 I can't eat soy and can't um don't want to eat more broccoli should I supplement no you shouldn't supplement um I just type in choline into nutrition effects at the organ fact so choline is an essential nutrient um but uh you don't want to get too much because see bad bacteria can change turn Coline to trimethylamine oxidized by liver and wreak havoc in the body so um but you should be able to get all the col you need from whole foods without taking supplements are there health issues associated with silicone cooking utensils not that I've seen um it's not I don't think it's something I've looked at particularly but I I did do a lot of videos on kind cooking impants and pots and pants I assume if something was bad I would pop up um but uh I have not seen anything offand but if you do a pub Med search and something comes up send it my way because I cook with silicone uh and so I'd want to know your my oh my books are life-changing thank you Fernanda um is calcium supplement from algae better no no no no no they no so we should not be supplementing for calcium not only um is not particularly effective it's not safe um and regardless of what kind of expense see you know calcium is so cheap you know calcium carbonate is just chalk right so it's dirt cheap and so that's why supplement company love coming up with all sorts of fancy Coral Calcium or algen calcium or whatever calcium so they can charge you more money but it's just a scam and in this case a danger scam because you're getting um too much of a calcium spike in your bloodstream check out my videos for more Fernandez back would I recommend statins for someone whose LDL was 190 oh Jesus uh 90 90's good uh uh I no not but 90 is way too high um uh oh and especially with a high LP little a um which is largely genetically determined so you need to get your LDL absolutely as low as possible certainly under 70 for primary prevention um and so I would uh go on the portfolio diet which is a plant-based diet with particularly foods that lower um LDL cholesterol and see how far you can take diet and if you can't get it down to Target then I absolutely talk to your um physician about prescribing you drugs Bonnie how much oh we already did that next up um meon YT Elm Elm seeds what the hell is an Elm seed I've never the reason you never found out anything on pupm is because no one eats Elm seeds as far as I know anyway not funny people are mastering diabetes claim the dietary fat not any dietary fat but particularly saturated fat causes insulin resistance in their diet they um restrict um fat to 10 15% is that necessary well that certainly is um more typical of uh how our species evolved getting about 10% calories from fat um uh but uh but the insulin resistance is really a problem with saturated fat in the context of excess calorie intake um uh but yeah but uh you know different fats are kind of a mixture of various fats and so for example there's some saturated fat in nuts even though nuts um uh have uh have uh you know overall benefit um this because all the other wonderful things in nuts but uh I could um um I think if you just restrict cetate fats which is meat Dairy and junk you should be able to uh um uh reverse your insulin resistance um hope BLB diet taking 2,000 micam C bom and want we great um uh oh have a slight deficiency well so the question is um how is that measured um so deficiency if you just got the serum blood levels of B12 there not a good uh actual sense of your functional B12 status so you can get a urine or serum MMA levels meth malonic acid level um and that's uh if you are deficient then you increase your levels um but increase your intake but uh but make sure you're actually deficient before you do that not that I mean you just pee out excess this water soluble vitamin do we need to worry about pH value making a DIY serum DIY vitamin C oh you know I wouldn't mix the vitamin C and nicomide together in serum I would do them separately just because um yeah I I don't know what the vitamin C would be doing to the nice camide uh fascinated by longevity research wild blueberry well Wild blueberry you would like my new book what specific blood Market oh interesting yeah so there's um all sorts of interesting kind of measures of biological aging there's lots of companies trying to fight it out to be the best um probably uh the kind of following the epigenetic clock is probably most uh uh most well validated but uh I'm not sure what uh commercial um I know what tests used in kind of a laboratory setting but not sure what is available commercially okay I um Jill takes synthoid for hypothyroidism can I take iodine drops when I eat my breakfast you need to wait hours and take with my other vitamins why are you taking iodine drops we you should be able to get IAM from Whole Foods um yeah yeah Ian so that that would be my question why are you taking idon drops if you're Iden efficient then you should eat more iDine rich foods like sea vegetables like Nory sheets or you know uh some do flakes or arme or wakame or something like that hello says Nile I was wondering if I give you ins said on artificial oh sucos I got videos on sucos um yes there is a health concern has to do with um uh causing disbiosis in the gut you know the sucos people like to brag how artificial sweetener doesn't get absorbed into the bloodstream so therefore it's safe but guess what if it doesn't get AB bloodstream what does it do it ends up in the colon where it mucks with our microbiome so don't do it if you want to see the science just type in sucros into nutritionfacts.org are puffed grains unhealthy yeah um puffing the puffing as well as kind of explosion Extrusion um all sorts of things to make kind of breakfast cereals it's just ways to kind of increase the glycemic index is not something we want so yeah I would uh that not even if they're whole grains there's better ways to get your grains like whole intact grains Okay um Asain same as suame um are they dangerous I talk about the downsides in my uh in videos just type in those in my nutritionfacts.org and videos will pop right up okay Victoria husband 63 been following Whole Food blumber D for years total cholesterol still oh my God LDL is way too high um yeah well so um you know a lot of people claim their on whole food blend-based diet are eating you know uh you know vegan junk food that has like you know tropical oils like cocon oil or something that'd be the first thing but if you really are eating Whole Foods and your LDL is that extraordinarily High um I would try the the portfolio diet as I talked about before David Jenkins University of Toronto um that's the best diet for maxim low in cholesterol but if you can't get it down to Target then uh you need to figure out another way now also there's lots of things you can take that also lower cholesterol like amla and things like that um but again if you can't do it by diet you have to get it down some way um and that can include drugs higher dose drugs multiple drugs whatever it takes to get your LDL um which is a primary risk factor for the number one killer of men and women Victoria again says Where could I buy fennel oh fenel vaginal cream or or how can I use it at home um I yeah um I have not looked for it online um and so yeah yeah so I talked about how fenel veginal creams can help with certain genital urinary symptoms menopause um so but just because research studies says something doesn't mean that you can actually find it I'm surprised that there isn't a market for it um so yeah me I would I would look online um if you can't find it may not be available sorry to hear that um I'm sure you go to local herbalist and they can make one for you that be that's a good idea um yeah there there we go um you know they could you know I don't know mate some some uh fennel in in oil or something and mix it with uh you know some kind of uh uh you know denser something like cocoa butter or something um but I talk to an herbalist they they would figure it out that's cool all right uh we did that one okay wealthy says what do we think about Peter Rogers never heard of him a more radical version of me how funny now I want to Google them I've never heard of them can I roast nuts on low temperature to avoid forming acrod umh it's not the acry amides we were about nuts acrylamides are more um um hyri heat of carbohydrates like crackers and and french fries potato chips um The Roasting the nut roasting causes formation of advanced gation and products um so um uh I think it starts occurring at like 250 um uh Fahrenheit so it's not really roasting nuts but if you can keep your nuts under that temperature I presumably You' be able to keep your ages low um I find them easier to chew than raw raw I don't know why Raw nuts would be hard to chew like raw walnuts are they hard to chew I don't know all right can I eat too much protein from Beans I hear doctors say more than a cup a day of beans oh why can't you eat more than a cup a day in fact I recommend my daily dozen cup and a half right three servings a day of legums um with a serving being a half cup how many beans can we eat we need why are we hurting your kidneys um beans do not hurt your kidneys in fact and that's the recommendation is switch over to plant protein for protecting um for chronic kidney failure patients um to protect one's kidneys by decreasing animal protein intake if you have extremely uh poor kidney function then they they want to decrease your protein overall but you need to talk to a renal dietitian definitely I ate Anthony ate a whole food plant-based di for four months oh my God lost 75 pounds congratulations but then four months bummer um uh oh it went back up maybe it's not even clear I took a tor now to gain back gain back oh 40 PBS um so I talk in how not to diet um I talk about what is behind the stalling of weight loss and uh gaining back weight and so check out go to your local public library get how not to diet and go to that chapter sorry to hear that Isabelle says um she's a huge fan that's nice can I advise what type what a oh a type one diabetic shouldn't should I need to prevent diabetic bone disease I don't think of diabetes causing bone disease um but I mean type one diabetes can be certainly serious um you know the the defeating diabetes or mastering diabetes folks um know a lot about type 1 diabetes so basically you're trying to improve insulin resistance just to make your body more sensitive to the insulin that you are injecting but you will be injecting or or that your child be injecting insulin for their whole Liv is critically important um uh to uh you know to Main Rin uh you know primarily to not bottom out and and have lifethreatening hypoglycemia um so yeah it's very close very important to work very closely with your uh medical professionals to make sure that they um keep their um blood sugar level St stable we can do that by improving uh insulin sensitivity so you can get into a regular regimen of know exactly how much insulin you need every day how long to microwave 1.5 ounces of mushroom to make sure the polyphenol oxidase is gone oh this is such a highle question I love it what is the optimal amount of mushrooms to eat every day I hear too much is a waste huh well I don't think so I've certainly never heard that no no eat as much mushrooms as you want um uh i' oh speaking of which I just made some past sauce and totally forgot my uh uh my Pini mushrooms I'm totally gonna add some ah funny anyway um uh oh uh uh it's in the video so I did aot like an hourlong Q&A talking about polyphenol oxidase um and didn't I talk about how much it's like I don't know 60 seconds or something how much uh don't quote me go to the go to the video where actually show the data on how many seconds it does not take much all right oh uh this is someone responding to somebody else Madison said would I what would I suggest for reactive hypoglycemia um uh you know it depends on what you mean by that that is a term that is um that is used kind of willy-nilly um so if I had more details about what exactly you're experiencing um uh I may be able to help you otherwise just talk to your doctor about it what are my thoughts about the NIH report talking on a study saying spermidine can cause stroke that I never heard of all right now you got me sper NIH stroke I am typing it into uh Pub met as we speak spermine serum spermine in relation to stroke so it's not talking about taking spermine it's talking about serum spermine um with spermine how Okay so this was a sounds like oh case control study um showing um higher uh stroke risk among people with higher levels of spermine that's interesting um uh um so that's neat um oh maybe it's that probably showed up too late for me to include um in the book um but um serum suedine um is linked to lower all cause mortality which is the most important thing is the most predictive nutrient um following you know hundreds of individuals between ages 45 and 64 found 146 components of people's di spermine was the single most um so say with h a longevity um so uh presumably that would wash out any stroke effect if there is even is a stroke effect um and they're certainly not taking about uh um so I possible there's reverse cation whatever but um that is totally interesting I'm going to look into that when I do my spermine update but so far um I would stick to my recommendation because of all cause mortality that's the most important thing um but uh I will look into it thank you so much for letting me know that's exciting oh and this study if anyone's interested is Zang at all Z he n g at all published 20 2022 um Sean says they're vegan and it's improved their health so much that's awesome stub cost this with this video this article this doesn't help me anything evidently I can't read attachments so sorry I don't know what article you're talking about how do autophagy Foods induce autophagy I mean you are not fasting while consuming them um so as I talk about in the talk and in the book I me can take days to really boost ay was too long to go on super device but there are foods like Chlor there are food components like chlorogenic acid the antioxidant coffee that actually have autopsy boosting effect um and so uh and look exercise it's like wait a second how can exercise boost autophagy if you're still eating because it boosts autophagy you can do muscle biopsies before and after 60 Minutes of Moder intensity activity like brisk walking show boost and autophagy so autophagy has just been associated with fasting that's just one of many ways to boost it um you can also avoid acryi contained Foods eating sperming r foods will um help boost atopy as well can I explain apob and how it compares to LDL for atherosclerosis risk um so apob B is kind of the protein that for that's kind of part of LDL um and just uh but it's also protein found in other kind of lipoprotein um conglomerates but LDL continues to be uh recommended as the really the best we testing companies always trying to come up with fancy methods to test LDL is just so dirt cheap they're not making a lot of money on it but uh it's hard to really beat out LDL for um uh predicting survival and cardiov vasd disease risk I would stick with the um thank you for my book says lazy um I have a question heard that Steve Jobs eats only plant-based di but he died early one could cause his illness I think he died of liver cancer I don't remember I did not uh I was not involved in his care so I cannot tell you will I make a video about what the heck is that I have never heard of such a term bakio what is bakio Baku coo maybe there's another name for it of something I've known oh it's a retinol alternative from the babg plant um it's a merit turpenoid that's interesting I've never heard of it I have never heard of it but the retinoids I mean we don't want it to work too much like retinoids because um you know the the trendin the the the alterans retinoic acid that people put in their face to improve skin appearance um increases the risk of death according to the only randomized control trial um a study that lasted long enough to actually be able to measure differences in death between people so um I certainly hope it doesn't uh work as well um so I wouldn't take it but I have not looked into it specifically if someone ate a pure carnivore diet how long how long could they devel how long could they develop you mean how long until they would develop scurvy the vitamin C deficiency disease um uh well it depends if you ate raw meat if you ate raw meat I don't recommend eating raw meat um don't recommend eating cook meat but uh raw meat has some vitamin C that's how you know like the the you know the Inuit could survive uh on you know eating you know whale whale carcasses um without much food during the winter months uh with much plant food during the winter months um how long does it take to develop scur I've got videos about it um I think it just takes a couple weeks in fact I talk about my fasting video anyway um it uh it takes a while to but that that's of all scurvy is not the reason why you don't want to do the carnivore diet you do the carnivore diet because it's going to uh uh because of the saturated fat intake the cholesterol intake etc etc all right 329 ah we are running out of time trying to think if there's a super qu question um if you have elevated liver enzymes can the liver heal if you drink non-alcoholic beer and why well the reason that your liver enzymes are high is because you they've been suffering alcoholic damage uh from the alcohol and if you stop drinking alcohol can your liver heal absolutely your liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate unless it's really far along and so yes stop drinking alcohol excellent that was easy thanks so much everybody I will talk to you next time hopefully see you on the road um I'm about half through with my speaking tour going till the end of June and hope to come to your city soon"

They need answers based on facts. In other words, in the peer-reviewed medical literature, and that is what I’m here for. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today we take a deep dive into drugs and supplements that don’t work as advertised. And we start with a deceptive supplement called Prevagen. Over the last twenty years or so, Big Pharma has invested more than a half trillion dollars into dementia treatment research, but so far to little avail. In light of this, many have turned to supplements. An AARP commissioned survey found that 36% of those 74 years and older take a supplement for brain health, to the tune of billions of dollars a year. The most commonly marketed brain supplement was one I’d frankly never heard of before: Prevagen. Prevagen contains a protein derived from a luminescent jellyfish the company claims ""has been clinically shown to improve memory."" According to the company website, “A landmark double-blind and placebo controlled trial demonstrated Prevagen improved short-term memory, learning, and delayed recall over 90 days.” But when you actually pull up the study, not only did Prevagen fail to improve memory, learning, or recall over placebo, it failed to show a significant improvement in any of the nine measured cognitive tasks tested. As an inquiry into Prevagen published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest was titled, “How Can This Memory Supplement Flunk Its One Trial and Still Be Advertised as Effective?” And not just as effective but the #1 pharmacist recommended brand. Considering the lack of sound clinical evidence, how is that possible? Presumably, they’re just as blitzed with the same kind advertising as everyone else. It’s no surprise the supplement didn’t do anything since the company’s own studies showed the jellyfish protein was rapidly digested by stomach enzymes. Of course, that didn’t stop them from raking in more than $20 million a year. Claiming the “marketers of Prevagen preyed on the fears of older consumers experiencing age-related memory loss,” the Federal Trade Commission and New York State’s Attorney General filed a consumer protection complaint, charging the company with making false and unsubstantiated claims. The AARP weighed in, accusing the company of “deceiving millions of aging Americans.” In a move straight out of the Big Pharma aducanumab playbook, the company went back and conducted more than 30 post hoc analyses of the data and found a few positive findings on a few tasks for some subgroups. This cherry-picking of subgroups after-the-fact is a classic example of manipulation sometimes called “p-hacking” or “data dredging” that can be described as “placing a bet on a horse after watching the race.” The makers of Prevagen settled a class action lawsuit in 2020 with the FTC over deceptive business practices and false advertising. Remarkably, though, the settlement allows them to continue to market it with the court-approved disclaimer that claims are “based on a clinical study of subgroups of individuals …” But with the amount of slicing and dicing of data they did, the chances of finding at least one false positive was estimated at 80 percent. Prevagen may be more than just a waste of money. The manufacturer was cited for failing to report more than a thousand adverse events related by consumers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Regulators can’t have it both ways, though. If the jellyfish protein is digested away, how can it pose a safety risk? Because dietary supplements are too often adulterated with contaminants. FDA inspectors specifically cited Prevagen’s manufacturing facilities for “objectionable conditions or practices.” A 2019 survey by Pew found that more than half believed that the Food and Drug Administration requires supplements be tested for safety, but that isn’t true. One study of 24 supplements sold as cognitive performance boosters found that most claimed an ingredient on the label that wasn’t actually in the supplement, and worse, 38 percent contained ingredients not allowed in supplements like prohibited drugs. Another study of a dozen so-called “brain health supplements” similarly found 8 out of 12 were misbranded (missing an ingredient promised on the label), and 10 out of 12 were deemed adulterated (containing unlisted compounds, for example caffeine in a product that explicitly highlighted all-caps ‘‘DECAFFEINATED’’ on the label). Only 1 out of 12 was certiﬁed to contain what it said it did. The bottom line for Prevagen: there is no acceptable evidence that it's effective. Patients should be advised not to take it. In our next story, we look at the safety and efficacy of two of the newest Alzheimer’s drug treatments. Aducanumab, sold as Aduhelm, is the first new drug approved for Alzheimer’s treatment in nearly 20 years. It involves getting IV infusions of an antibody that targets the amyloid plaque protein, which represents a core brain pathology in the disease. After a phase 1 study found no change in the placebo group, but a dramatic reduction in amyloid plaque burden at different doses of the drug, they jumped straight to phase 3: two randomized controlled trials to put it to the test on thousands of Alzheimer’s patients. Unfortunately, both trials were stopped early after a “futility analysis” deemed them failures, as cognition and function continued to decline in the treatment groups. That shouldn’t be surprising since over the last 20 years there have been more than 20 amyloid-targeting therapies that have universally failed to offer meaningful cognitive beneﬁt for people with Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, a 2022 investigation into a seminal paper implicating amyloid as a causal factor in Alzheimer's alleged “shockingly blatant” data fraud, which has further tarnished the reputation of the amyloid theory. So, no surprise Aduhelm flopped, but what happened next was surprising indeed. Just when the drug’s prospects seemed dead, Biogen, the drug company that developed it, launched a secret campaign, code-named “Project Onyx,” to use back channels to convince the Food and Drug Administration to approve it anyway. They went back through the data and found the subset of patients in one of the trials that had a 0.39 increase on an 18-point scale of cognitive function. This was well below the minimal standard for clinical significance (judged to be at least 1 or 2 full points), and the same subset, at the same dose, in the other study they funded failed to find even that effect. This kind of post-hoc, after-the-fact data dredging is like “firing a shotgun at a barn and then painting a target around the bullet holes,” as one FDA committee statistician put it. FDA reviewers thoroughly demolished Biogen’s re-analysis, concluding “there is no compelling substantial evidence of treatment effect  or disease slowing … ” The American Academy of Neurology noted that 35 percent of those getting aducanumab suffered swelling or bleeding in the brain within the first four months of treatment— one in three—ten times more than those in the placebo group. So, not surprisingly, not a single member of the FDA expert advisory panel voted in favor of approval (10 out of 11 voted against with 1 “uncertain”). Yet the FDA ignored its own advisory committee, and in 2021 approved the drug anyway. The FDA admitted the submitted data “left residual uncertainties regarding clinical benefit” and so couldn’t give it the standard approval, which involves a designation that the drug is safe and effective. Instead, they used an “accelerated approval” pathway that allows drugs to be accepted on the basis of surrogate markers, in this case amyloid clearance. But more than two dozen other amyloid-targeting treatments flopped. And despite convincing plaque reduction, there were no clinical improvements or even worsening of the disease. The FDA approval of aducanumab proved to be one of the most controversial in recent memory. The approval despite near unanimous opposition by its own expert committee is virtually unprecedented, leading three of the committee members to resign in protest, one of them called it “probably the worst drug approval decision in recent US history.” The response from the scientific community may best be summed up by a commentary written by the head of the American Geriatrics Society entitled, “My head just exploded …” The FDA did stipulate that Biogen would have to run a “post-marketing” trial proving that the drug actually has some benefit, but has until 2030 to report the results. Meanwhile, Biogen is charging $56,000 per person per year for the drug, with out-of-pocket expenses estimated at up to $11,000 annually. And this doesn’t include the costs of IV administration or the sequential $4,000 to $7,000 MRI scans needed to monitor for the brain bleeds and swelling. Yeah, the risks far exceed any likely benefits, but shouldn’t patients and their families be able to make up their own minds? The problem is that the FDA stamp of approval implies aducanumab is safe and effective, when at the current time it appears to be neither. The official position statement of the American Medical Directors Association, which specializes is long-term care facilities, is that the drug is “likely to have extraordinarily negative consequences” for the millions living with dementia in this country. The European equivalent of the FDA does not seem as easily swayed by Big Pharma, recommending refusal of the drug. I mean, that’s the whole point of drug regulation, as one of the former FDA committee members who resigned put it: a responsibility to help vulnerable patients and their families, not just from sketchy drugs but also from false hopes. A congressional investigation concluded FDA approval of aducanumab was “rife with irregularities,” raising “serious concerns about FDA’s lapses in protocol and Biogen’s disregard of efficacy.” Of course, that didn’t stop the FDA from their 2023 accelerated approval of a similar antibody, lecanemab (sold as Lequembi), of similar questionable efficacy and safety. Did you know that there's little guarantee that a dietary supplement will actually contain what is advertised on the packaging? Here’s the story. In a video I did a few years ago, I talked about how press releases about the latest science coming out of even top medical centers were filled with overstatements and omissions. Medical journal press releases suffered from similar problems, and press releases from the drug companies themselves were no different, filled with hype and exaggeration. What about press releases issued by the supplements industry? Not even the companies that published the studies, but like trade organizations for the multi-billion-dollar dietary supplement industry? Researchers found that 100% of supplements industry press releases contained ""spin,"" meaning strategies to hype or denigrate findings to distort the results of clinical studies. And here's the crazy part: industry press releases advocated supplement use in response to more than 90% of even the studies that reported no benefit or harm. A study comes out showing a supplement is actually bad for you, and the vast majority of independent institutions like the National Institutes of Health or mainstream media stories are like ""don't take it."" Duh. But the industry trade organizations are like, ""Harm? Go for it! Buy an extra bottle."" It is, therefore, likely that the propagation of the spin-enriched industry press releases contributes to the ongoing, and even burgeoning, enthusiasm for use of supplements in the face of accumulating evidence of most of their ineffectiveness and, in some cases, harm. In some cases, people are paying to make themselves sick. Sadly, the science may not even matter to many supplement users. Most dietary supplement users said that they would be minimally influenced by independent, taxpayer-funded studies contradicting the efficacy claims of supplement manufacturers. Only a minority of users said they would stop taking a supplement if public health authorities stated that it was just a waste of money. The iconic image of the snake oil salesman was actually a real dude: Clark ""the Rattlesnake King"" Stanley in 1916. Turns out that Stanley's snake oil, in fact, contained no snake oil at all but rather just like spicy mothballs and turpentine, prosecuted under the newly enacted Pure Food and Drug Act, and ultimately fined a lofty sum of $20 bucks. And a century later, here we are with snake oil coming out our ears, a vast number of supplements marketed and sold without routine oversight. Now, the supplement industry bristles at such talk, saying that the supplement industry is regulated to protect consumers. And it's true there are definitely laws on the books, but the ability of regulators to successfully carry out this mission is hampered by the sheer number of products. The FDA estimates there are more than 85,000 dietary supplement products currently available in the U.S. alone. So there's the sheer number, the under reporting of adverse side effects, the difficulty of successfully prosecuting cases against offenders, and the ease with which suppliers can rebrand products removed from the shelves have led to a largely unregulated environment. In the real world, there is little guarantee that a supplement will even contain what is advertised on the packaging and not contain unlisted ingredients, potentially leading to significant harms, resulting in an estimated 23,000 ER visits every year. Now, of course, prescription drugs don't just sicken but kill many more, making them perhaps the third leading cause of death, wiping out more than 100,000 Americans, but still, the less death and disability, the better. Dietary supplements are often adulterated with undeclared pharmaceuticals, which could represent an enormous risk to consumers, most often found in erectile dysfunction, weight loss, diabetes, and high blood pressure supplements. But wait a second. What about supplement manufacturers who say they have independent, third-party certification of purity? There is a practice called ""dry labbing,"" a dirty little secret of the supplements industry, where quality assurance labs just rubber stamp fake documents. And if you think that's outrageous, check out the story of BMPEA. A researcher at Harvard published a paper replicating prior research from the FDA detecting a designer amphetamine-like stimulant, beta-methylphenylethylamine, in various U.S. supplements sold in the United States. In response, one of the offenders, Hi-Tech Pharmaceuticals, manufacturers of weight loss supplements like Black Widow and Yellow Scorpion, sued the Harvard researcher for libel, slander, and product disparagement, originally to the tune of $200 million in damages. This was all documented in a piece by STAT, which is an excellent source of medical journalism that I recommend. The head of Hi-Tech openly admitted that he was ""hoping that we were able to silence this guy."" And while ultimately unsuccessful in court, Hi-Tech's lawsuit effectively sent a warning to other researchers. In fact, Hi-Tech's CEO is attributed as saying, he ""hope[s] that the long and costly legal battle will scare away other academics from investigating the supplement industry.""

""Adrenal fatigue"" is the prototypical example. Chiropractor-coined in 1998, the invented diagnosis has since been embraced by naturopaths, functional medicine, and anti-aging doctors. But does adrenal fatigue even exist? The alleged condition is said to result from chronic stress leading to an ""overuse"" of the adrenal glands and their eventual functional decline. Symptoms supposedly include fatigue, body aches, sleep issues, and digestive problems, at least according to the websites not so coincidentally selling a suite of supplements to remedy it. It will come as no surprise that the originator of the term sells supplements on his website to treat it for $200 a month. But it may not be an actual medical condition. The symptoms people have are real, but they just may be caused by something else, for example, sleep apnea, chronic fatigue syndrome, or fibromyalgia. Saliva tests for adrenal hormone levels are not reliable, with studies showing so-called ""adrenal fatigue"" patients having higher levels than controls, similar levels, or lower levels, ""an almost systematic finding of conflicting results."" There is an actual disease of adrenal insufficiency known as Addison's disease, which is diagnosed with an ACTH stimulation test. You inject people with adrenocorticotropic hormone, the signal your brain uses to get your adrenal glands to pump out the stress hormone cortisol, and if your adrenals don't respond, that shows your adrenal glands must be in trouble. But inject those presumed to be suffering from chronic stress and fatigue with ACTH and sometimes you even get a greater rise in cortisol, disproving the notion that stress causes the adrenals to ""burn out."" But wait, you were diagnosed with ""AF,"" given corticosteroids, and now you feel great, so it must have been real. That's the thing about corticosteroids, though. One of the side effects is a euphoric sense of well-being. The problem is that even low doses can increase the risk of osteoporosis, psychiatric and metabolic disorders, muscle damage, glaucoma, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular diseases. But wait, you took some ""adrenal support"" supplements, checked the labels, confirmed they don't have any hormones, and still felt better. They lie. Researchers checked the 12 most popular adrenal support supplements, and every single one contained hidden hormones, none of which were declared on the product labels. All contained thyroid hormone and most a steroid hormone as well, pregnenolone, budesonide, androstenedione, progesterone, cortisone, or cortisol. Adrenal fatigue reminds me of what used to be called ""electromagnetic hypersensitivity,"" now referred to in the medical literature as ""idiopathic environmental intolerance attributed to electromagnetic fields,"" unspecific symptoms supposedly triggered by things like cell phones. There have been at least 46 studies involving more than 1,000 people that claim to be affected, yet when put to the test in blinded trials the studies near universally failed to show that anyone could even detect the fields. Why don't journalists covering these stories mention the data? Because there are snake-oil salesmen profiting off the perceived condition, selling all matter of so-called ""protective"" gadgets that viciously attack anyone even daring to mention the science, accusing them of denying the reality of people's symptoms. But it's arguably the opposite. They are the ones hindering sufferers from getting to the bottom of what is actually causing their symptoms. Similarly, hawking unproven tests and treatments for adrenal fatigue could delay the diagnosis of a real, treatable condition."

When unrealistic hopes clash with reality, the disappointment may lead to an abandonment of weight-loss efforts altogether as an exercise in futility, no pun intended. Our false expectations may also give us license to overeat. Our pie-in-the-sky notions about the power of exercise may just be used to justify an extra slice of pie right here on earth. Some researchers warn that labeling menus with calorie equivalents of exercise could be counterproductive, backfiring if people rationalize their indulgences after a workout. This concern has actually been put to the test. Exercise psychologists took a group men and women, put them on a stationary bike, and had them cycle until they burned either 50 calories or more than 250 calories. Unbeknownst to them, the researchers manipulated the machines to give false readouts, such that in actuality both groups burned the same number of calories. They just thought they burned more or less. Then, they were offered a meal 10 minutes later, ostensibly to measure the ""effects of exercise on taste perception,"" but the real purpose was to covertly measure how much people ate. Those who falsely believed they had burned off more calories did seem to demonstrate a greater ""license to eat,"" ending up eating significantly more calories, mostly in the form of chocolate chip cookies. After a workout, people may be tempted to treat themselves for their sweaty sacrifice. To prevent this kneejerk reaction from undermining our efforts, we should strive to make exercise less of a chore. In a paper entitled ""Is it fun or exercise? The framing of physical activity biases subsequent snacking,"" a study is described in which individuals were randomized to the same amount of physical activity but just described differently. Half were told they were going on a ""scenic walk,"" and the other half were told they were going on an ""exercise walk."" Afterwards, researchers covertly measured how much dessert everyone took at a subsequent meal. Those in the movement-as-exercise group reportedly served themselves about 35 percent more chocolate pudding than the movement-as-fun group. This is all the more reason to choose activities that are enjoyable, such as walking with friends or while listening to music, or watching a video on the treadmill. Reframing exercise as play rather than work may not only make for a more sustainable regimen but may make us less likely to consciously or unconsciously feel the need to later reward ourselves at the buffet line. Even just thinking about exercise may compel people to eat more food. Those randomized to simply read about physical activity went on to serve themselves nearly 60 percent more M&Ms than those in the control group, adding up to hundreds of extra calories. The researchers concluded: ""simply imagining exercise leads participants to serve themselves more food."" Expending energy through exercise may not just psychologically predispose us to eat more but may physiologically make us hungrier. We evolved in the context of scarcity, so our body places great value on rapidly replenishing lost fat stores. This helps explain why the average weight loss with exercise training is only 30 percent of that predicted based on the number of extra calories burned. Calories in versus calories out can be complicated by the fact that changes on one side of the equation can affect the other side. In other words, we can work up an appetite. Carefully controlled studies show that caloric intake tends to rise over time to match any increase in caloric expenditure, making significant weight loss through exercise alone remarkably difficult. This doesn't happen over a day or two. After a workout, there may not be an immediate increase in hunger, but averaged over the week or weeks, our appetite does tend to increase to balance out most of the extra calories we've been burning. This calorie compensation isn't perfect, though, so we can end up with a net loss in body fat, particularly at higher exercise levels. So, the secret to weight loss through exercise may be sheer volume, at least 300 minutes a week to achieve appreciable fat loss. This regulation of our appetite through activity works in both directions. Just as there exists a higher level of exercise where we can start to outpace our appetite and lose weight, there's a lower level of exercise where our body loses the ability to sufficiently downgrade our appetite, and we gain weight. This sedentary zone where our appetite becomes uncoupled from our activity level appears to start at around 7,100 steps a day. So, let's say you start out as a really active person, chowing down on nearly 2,900 calories a day, and, for whatever reason, have to cut back on exercise. You'd think you'd gain a lot of weight, but you're surprised that you don't. Basically, no increased odds of gaining significant body fat. What happened? With your drop in exercise came an inadvertent drop in appetite. But there's a limit to how far our appetite can drop. Once you cross that threshold, once you dip below logging at least 7,100 steps or so a day on your pedometer, your appetite doesn't slow much further to match, and the pounds can start to pile on. Your body tries to keep your weight steady by adjusting your appetite, but we just weren't designed to handle such extreme low levels of movement that sadly characterizes most of the U.S. population."

Well, the number of tickets went up for cannabis-impaired driving in Washington State after legalization, and the proportion of drivers in fatal car crashes in Colorado who tested positive went up. But in both cases, this may simply reflect the general increase in marijuana use overall. It doesn't mean the cannabis is causing the crashes. Yeah, there’s lots of evidence correlating marijuana use with car accidents. But you have to ask yourself who uses marijuana? Mostly young people and males. And guess who has higher crash risk regardless of what they smoke? Young people and males. But taking that into account, it does seem that roughly 20 to 30% of traffic crashes involving cannabis use occur because of the cannabis use. To put that in perspective, though, that number is more like 85% when it comes to alcohol. Yeah, but are the cannabis crashes just low velocity fender bender bumps from some wasted driver going like five miles an hour? After a systematic review of the literature, this compilation of studies examining acute cannabis consumption and motor vehicle collisions “found a near doubling of risk of a driver being involved in a motor vehicle collision resulting in serious injury or death.” So, that’s pretty serious; though again, alcohol is even worse. Yes, cannabis may double or triple the risk of car crashes, but alcohol may multiply the risk like 6 to 15-fold. The combo may be worse, though; 25 times the odds of fatal car crash involvement testing positive for both. The safety consequence of cannabis intoxication when driving is listed as a primary concern about cannabis legalization. OK, well what happened in the states where marijuana was legalized? How much did traffic fatalities go up? They didn’t. In fact,  they went down. What? Why does legalizing pot reduce traffic fatalities? Because of reduced alcohol consumption. They found that legalization of weed was associated with reduced alcohol consumption; so yes, more drugged driving, but less drunk driving— and that’s so much worse, that overall, fatalities went down. So, perhaps we’d also see less liver disease, less alcohol-induced brain damage, as pot substitutes for some of the alcohol use. Cannabis is unlikely to produce as much harm as alcohol because, unlike alcohol, cannabis does not cause liver or gastrointestinal diseases, not fatal in overdoses, and does not appear as neurotoxic as alcohol, and it’s not as potent a cause of car crashes as alcohol, either. The health problems of cannabis dependence, like bronchitis and memory impairment, are much less serious, on average, than those suffering from alcohol dependence. But this does not mean that cannabis dependence is a minor problem, but public health authorities can be criticized for bringing that up. It’s like in the 40s and 50s after the repeal of prohibition, you still need to warn people about the problems of heavy drinking, liver cirrhosis, alcoholism, but you’d just get dismissed as some temperance propagandist. And now we see a similar thing, where the public health profession wants to educate people about the adverse health effects of cannabis, but are dismissed as reefer madness hysterics. Still, it’s important to put these adverse health effects in perspective. How does the safety of cannabis stack up against alcohol and tobacco? According to the CDC, alcohol is linked to approximately 88,000 deaths per year, whereas the deaths due to cannabis are from things like car accidents, and they go down when more people smoke pot because alcohol is so much worse. With hindsight, we can clearly see the enormous problems that have been caused by the legal drugs—tobacco and alcohol. If asked to decide today which psychoactive drugs should be legal, cannabis might well be much higher on the list."

They need answers based on facts. In other words, in the peer-reviewed medical literature, and that is what I’m here for. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today we have the second in a two part series where I offer some highlights from my latest book, How Not to Age, taped in front of a live audience. We pick up our story with tips on how to keep our vital organs in good working order. What can we do to protect our bones, bowels, bladder, and circulation? Our hair, hearing, and hormone balance? Immune function, joint health? Our minds and our muscles? Sex life and skin? Our teeth, vision, and finally, our dignity in death. Let me just share a few quick pearls. For example, did you know that 85 percent of bone-related fracture risk has nothing to do with your bone mineral density? That’s just been drilled into our heads by big pharma and a billion-dollar bone density screening industry. Fractures are primarily due to falling, not osteoporosis. So, it’s the age-related muscle loss and impaired balance that may be breaking most of our bones— which is good news, because there’s something we can do something about it. Seven randomized controlled trials found that strength and balance training can cut fracture rates nearly in half— and that’s just during the trial. In the five years after this one-year study ended, those who had previously been randomized to the combined strength and balance group, suffered 74 percent fewer fractures. That’s far more effective than osteoporosis drugs like Fosamax that can cause fractures— atypical femoral fractures, in as many as 1 in 300 users. They are called “atypical,” because they occur not after a fall or trauma but just during routine activities, like walking, twisting at the hip, or even just standing still. Thanks to the drug, your femur, your thigh bone, the biggest bone in your body— just cracks in half. Too cruel an irony from a drug that’s supposed to protect your bones. After bones, I talk about preserving your bowel function in chapter number two. Randomize constipated diabetics to either cookies containing a tablespoon (20 g) a day of ground flaxseeds or flax-free placebo cookies for 12 weeks and not only does the flax improve constipation symptoms but resulted in an eight-pound weight loss over placebo, 25-point lower blood sugars, an astounding drop in hemoglobin A1c, and 17-point lower LDL cholesterol. All for about 10 cents a day of ground flaxseeds. For a head-to-head test between flaxseeds and psyllium, sold as Metamucil, a third cookie group was added with 10 grams of psyllium, and the flaxseed beat out the psyllium for constipation relief, weight, blood sugars, and cholesterol— and, is about four times cheaper. Flaxseeds were also directly compared to the prescription laxative lactulose and worked better as well. Bladder function! The prevalence of overactive bladder syndrome increases with age, reaching about one in three. No wonder bladder-relaxing drugs are a multibillion-dollar industry, yet may only reduce bathroom breaks by a half a pee a day compared to placebo. But a quarter teaspoon (500 mg) a day of dried cranberry powder worked nearly four times better, about two fewer daily trips to the bathroom over placebo, and that’s without any of the drug’s side effects: dry mouth, constipation, sedation, impaired cognition, rapid heartbeat, urinary retention, and the visual disturbances that lead almost two-thirds to stop taking the drugs, whereas cranberries are just tangy. Urinary incontinence is a common problem among older adults, particularly women, thanks to childbirth. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy like Premarin actually makes it worse, but local, vaginal estrogen may help. What works five times better than estrogen cream though? Kegel exercises, pelvic floor exercises, as I detail in the section “Jacked in the Box.” For men, urinary issues are more an enlarged prostate problem, having to get up multiple times at night, wee hours of the night. Cranberries to the rescue there again. Even just an eighth of a teaspoon (250 mg) a day of powdered cranberries can significantly improve prostate symptoms. You can buy cranberry powder in bulk at a cost of less than a penny per day. What about saw palmetto, the most common herbal supplement used for prostate symptoms? Based on dozens of randomized, controlled trials involving nearly 5,000 men: no clinical benefits. But pumpkin seeds work. More than a thousand men with prostate symptoms were randomized to either about a tablespoon (15 g) a day of plain pumpkin seed kernels, a proprietary pumpkin seed extract, or a placebo. The study was funded by the drug company that made the supplement, but the supplement totally flopped, while the pumpkin seeds themselves worked. Pumpkin seed oil was pitted against the leading drug for hair loss in women. A little less than a quarter teaspoon (1 ml) applied to the scalp once a day versus a dose of the drug, and they both worked, but the drug worked better. Rosemary oil, however, may be more closely matched. A hundred balding men were randomized to twice a day minoxidil like Rogaine versus a rosemary lotion. It took six months, but significant comparable improvement in hair counts in both groups, with no significant difference between the two. The rosemary lotion appeared to work as well as the drug. If you want to give it a DIY try, you can premix about 10 drops of rosemary essential oil to each fluid ounce (30 ml) of your favorite lotion and rub a quarter teaspoon (1.23 ml) into your scalp twice a day. Cost-wise, that much rosemary oil would come out to be about a penny per week. Let’s move on from hair highlights to hormones. I touched upon how menopausal hormone therapy can increase the risk of urinary incontinence, but that’s not all. If a thousand postmenopausal women take the standard hormone regimen for ten years, you’d not only expect 876 extra cases of urinary incontinence that they would not have got otherwise, but nine more cases of invasive breast cancer, eight more cases of heart disease, probably 22 more cases of dementia, 21 more cases of gallbladder disease, nine more strokes, and 21 more blood clots— though not a single partridge nor pear tree. However, hormone therapy is highly effective in decreasing menopausal hot flashes. Is there any way to keep cool without the clots and cancer? In the U.S., menopausal hot flashes are considered inevitable, but there isn’t even a word for hot flash in Japanese. This may be due to their greater consumption of soy foods, but you don’t really know until you put it to the test. Harvard’s Center of Excellence in Women’s Health funded a randomized, crossover trial of a half a cup (118 ml) of unsalted soy nuts a day and achieved about a 40 to 45 percent reduction in hot flashes within two weeks compared to the control group. Given that a plant-based diet may also be effective for managing menopausal symptoms, researchers decided to combine the two: a plant-based diet plus whole soybeans. In fact, two randomized controlled trials found that plant-based nutrition with a daily half cup (86 g) of cooked whole soybeans can reduce the number of serious hot flashes by 84 to 88 percent within twelve weeks. Overall, most randomized to the plant-based bean group ended up free of moderate-to-severe hot flashes compared to about 95 percent still suffering in the control group. Lots of other things can help. Whole fennel seeds, powdered into capsules to pit them against placebo in a double-blind trial significantly improved menopausal symptoms at a dose of just a teaspoon (2 g) a day. Fenugreek may also help at a dose of one and a half teaspoons (6 g) a day, though not as much as hormones, but without the side effects. Though fenugreek can make your pee smell like maple syrup, sounds like a bonus! The nice thing about studying spices is that entire servings can be stuffed into a pill, to pit them against placebo. A quarter teaspoon (1 g) of black cumin powder a day led to significant improvements in memory and other tests of cognition within nine weeks compared to placebo. Black sesame seeds— less than a teaspoon (2.52 g) a day of ground black sesame seeds— stuffed into capsules against placebo, drove down systolic blood pressures by eight points within a month. If sustained, that alone could decrease the risk of stroke by about a quarter. What else can we powder? Strawberries! Osteoarthritis patients were randomized to two ounces (50 g) of freeze- dried strawberry powder versus a fake, strawberry-flavored and colored placebo powder, and, compared to placebo, the real strawberries signiﬁcantly decreased constant pain, intermittent pain, and total knee pain, and improved disability and overall quality of life. Osteoarthritis is the most frequent cause of physical disability among older adults, yet how do we treat it? Acetaminophen—Tylenol is considered the first-line pain killer, but guess what: it doesn’t work. I mean—it works, just not much better than a sugar pill, but at least it’s not going to make matters worse, like other things we doctors have cooked up, like steroid injections, which actively worsen joint deterioration and offer no greater pain relief than placebos. Or arthroscopic surgery, which may end up tripling our risk of ending up having to get a total full knee replacement. I mean so, even if the strawberry study is some total fluke, what’s the worst that can happen, tastier smoothies? And less than a quarter of a teaspoon (~1.25 ml) of ground ginger a day can beat out placebo for joint pain. Researchers conclude ginger, ""therefore, is recommended as a safe drug for these patients,” but by “drug” they just mean a couple pinches of the ground ginger you can buy at any store. There was even a study on topical ginger— at least, when applied to the scrotum. Paper-thin slices of ginger applied over the inflamed testicles, and the researchers were, on the ball, healing nearly three times faster than the control group. There have been more than a hundred randomized, controlled trials on ginger, shown to help with nausea and vomiting and everything from COVID to PMS. Heavy periods, painful periods, migraine headaches, multiple sclerosis, and the list goes on. Bottom line: “Mounting evidence suggests ginger can promote healthy aging.” What about garlic? Clinically proven to protect against those who vant to suck your blood. Literally. A hundred marines were randomized to a clove a day or placebo, and those on garlic had significantly fewer tick bites. Though sadly, garlic does not appear to help against other bloodsuckers. So far, I’ve touched on preserving your bones, bowels, bladder, hair, hormones, and joints, but preserving your mind is the largest chapter in the book, because dementia is one of our most pressing public health problems and the most feared condition of later life. There’s a common misconception that we have no control over whether we develop dementia, but the good news is that although Alzheimer’s may be incurable, at least it is preventable. There is an emerging consensus, that “what is good for our hearts is also good for our heads."" Clogged with cholesterol, closing off our arteries— clamping down on blood flow. What kind of brain arteries do you want in your head? Too much cholesterol in our blood is unanimously recognized to be a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Those with a total cholesterol of 225 mg/dL or more may have nearly 25 times the odds of ending up with amyloid plaques in their brain 10 to 15 years later. Cholesterol explains how the Alzheimer's gene APOE4 ravages the brain. After all, APOE is the primary cholesterol carrier in the brain. LDL cholesterol in those with bad gene variants of APOE averages 40 points higher, but switch people to a diet lower in animal fat and that cholesterol difference can be effectively smoothed out. So, diet can trump genetics. This may explain the so-called Nigerian paradox, where they have among the highest rates of the Alzheimer's gene but some of the lowest rates of Alzheimer’s disease. How is that possible? Genes load the gun, but lifestyle pulls the trigger. The paradox may be explained by their low cholesterol levels, probably because of their diets low in animal fat. Human beings may have evolved to maintain an LDL cholesterol level of around 25 mg/dL, but the average in the Western world is approximately 120 mg/dL. No wonder heart disease is the leading cause of death in high income countries, and dementia is killer #2. That helps explain why the so-called Alzheimer’s gene is the single most important gene when it comes to longevity, too. Which is good news, because even if we’ve been dealt some bad genetic cards, we still may be able to reshuffle the deck with diet. So, in terms of dietary guidelines for the prevention of Alzheimer’s, we should center our diets around vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains. In other words, the dietary pillar of lifestyle medicine: whole food, plant-based, nutrition. Or even simpler, plants, plants, and more plants. Any plants in particular? Note that the directors of Loma Linda’s Alzheimer’s Prevention Program single out berries and greens. Eating strawberries and spinach can mitigate age-related cognitive decline in rats, but what about in people? When the cognition of hundreds of twins was followed over a decade, consuming the berry pigments in less than a quarter cup (23 g) of blueberries a day or about a daily cup (138 g) of strawberries was associated with slowed cognitive aging by about four years, and nearly all of the randomized controlled trials of blueberries and cognitive performance found improvements in at least one brain domain, perhaps, because blueberry consumption can improve blood flow to certain critical regions of the brain. Now, the one study that flopped mixed the berries with milk, and we know the addition of milk prevents the artery protective effects of tea and prevents the bump in antioxidants that you’d normally get eating dark chocolate and impairs the absorption of the autophagy-activating compounds in coffee. What about mixing berries and cream? The antioxidant activity of blueberries is not just impaired by milk. Researchers found that the total antioxidant capacity of our bloodstream (measured in two different ways) shoots up within an hour of eating a cup-and-a-half (200 g) of blueberries with water and remains elevated five hours later. With milk, maybe one would expect less of a bump? But in fact, they ended up even worse than when they started. After eating a whole bowl of blueberries, they ended up with less antioxidant capacity in their body— because they ate blueberries with milk. One reason greens may be referred to as an anti-Alzheimer’s plant is because dark green leafy vegetables can also improve blood flow in the brain in interventional trials. Randomize older adults to the greens pigments found in about a cup (12 mg) a day’s worth of cooked kale and see significant improvements in complex attention, cognitive flexibility. And those randomized to even just a half cup of kale’s worth of the cruciferous compound sulforaphane got significant improvements in processing speed and working memory. Here’s the rate of cognitive decline in elderly men and women eating a serving a day of green leafies, compared to those only eating greens about once every ten days. Are you sitting down? “The rates of decline among those who consumed 1 to 2 servings of greens a day was the equivalent to being 11 years younger… .” So, now are you sitting down to a big salad? Greens come up in chapter after chapter. What’s the recommendation for preventing age-related macular degeneration, our leading cause of blindness? Or even treating it in its earliest stages? Consume a diet high in green leafy vegetables. We’re talkin’ two to three servings a day, so at least greens at every lunch and supper, with bonus points for sneaking them into breakfast in, say, a green smoothie. In fact, blending greens can triple the bioavailability of a key, vision- protecting nutrient. The main reason greens make it into in my Anti-Aging 8 though, is because of the nitrates in a serving or two of cooked greens can slow our metabolic rate for the same reason, a little shot of beet juice can help free divers hold their breath longer, because it improves the efficiency of our mitochondria, the little power plants in our cells, allowing us to effectively extract more energy from each breath. Another dietary intervention that has a similar effect on slowing metabolism is calorie restriction. The candle that burns half as bright burns twice as long. But instead of starving all the time, you can just eat a big salad. What else can greens do? In the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study, the consumption of leafy greens appeared to protect against the development of frailty, and when put to the test in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the equivalent of two thirds of a cup (158 ml) of spinach led to a significant boost in muscle strength, muscle quality, and muscle mass in older men and women. A single cup (240 ml) of cooked greens worth of vegetable nitrates significantly boosted maximal power and velocity in quads so much it was “functionally equivalent, to acutely reversing the effects of several decades of aging.” A single cup (240 ml) of cooked greens! Of course, when most people think about maintaining muscle mass into old age, they don’t think spinach, they think protein. But if you put together all of the randomized, controlled trials of adding extra protein to the diets of older men and women, you find no evidence that adding protein increases muscle mass or strength. Yeah, but what if you have sarcopenia, excessive age-related muscle loss? Surely then, protein helps, right? No. No significant effect on physical performance or muscle strength. What does work? Exercise. When it comes to age-related muscle loss, it’s use it or lose it. But maybe exercise plus protein? No. Protein supplementation does not significantly augment the effects of strength training in older adults. In fact, one of my Anti-Aging 8 is protein restriction. Why do longevity experts like Valter Longo recommend people cut down on protein to live longer? Here’s what Luigi Fontana wrote in his book. He’s the director of another leading longevity research center. Excess protein may not mass your muscles, but it will accelerate aging. How do you boost the pro-longevity hormone FGF21? Dietary protein restriction. How do you suppress the age-accelerating enzyme IGF-1? You do it through dietary protein restriction. How do you suppress the so-called motor of aging, mTOR? Dietary protein restriction. In fact, protein restriction was the only intervention I could find that could slow down all 11 of the aging pathways, which is good news because it’s easier to cut back on protein than it is to cut back on everything and walk around starving all the time. And, it may even be easier than that. Most or all of the life-extending benefits of protein restriction may be due to just restricting particular amino acids like methionine. In that case, you could even keep your protein intake the same but just swap sources, from animal proteins like meat to plant-based sources like beans. So, in humans, methionine restriction can be achieved using a predominately plant-based diet, which makes methionine restriction feasible as a life-extension strategy. Of course, drug companies look at this same data and think: What pharmaceuticals can we develop to mimic these dietary interventions? Anything else to maintain muscle mass other than greens and machines? How about cocoa beans! Older men and women randomized to a single tablespoon (22 g) of regular cocoa powder a day experienced a significant improvement in muscle strength, muscle mass, and all four tests of physical performance. And no, the study was not funded by Hershey’s. Unfortunately, the tastiest cocoa doesn’t work as well. The control groups here were given the same amount of highly Dutched cocoa— alkalized cocoa, where some of the bitter compounds removed in the Dutching process are the very flavonoids responsible for the benefits. But natural cocoa is so good it can improve walking performance in those with peripheral artery disease, not only by improving blood flow, but, as muscle biopsies showed, by improving mitochondrial activity. This is consistent with improved mitochondrial structure as well in biopsies taken from people’s quads. Though this study was actually funded by Hershey’s. What else can cocoa do? Increase the circulation within our skin, boosting it 70 percent within two hours, after less than a tablespoon. Do that every day and within three months, you end up with significantly improved skin thickness, density, and hydration, but no change in wrinkles. However, keep it up for six months, and you do see an improvement in wrinkles, a significant decrease of wrinkle depth, along with an improvement in skin elasticity within 12 weeks— all by making your life a little more chocolatey, by just adding some natural cocoa powder to your daily diet. I put it in my oatmeal with some canned water-packed tart cherries for a chocolate-covered cherry sensation. What else can we do for our skin? Well, there certainly are other antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, glycotoxin-free foods; so, when patients inquire about a diet that might contribute to younger-looking skin, evidence supports a recommendation to follow a whole food, plant-based diet. But the most important thing to prevent skin aging is avoid the sun. Exposure to sunlight may account for 90 percent of visible skin aging. That’s why dermatologists agree there’s nothing more important to slow the signs of aging than to protect your skin from the sun. So, the gold standard is considered to be the use of sunscreens in the daytime and “retinoids” at night. They’re talking about a prescription- only form of topical vitamin-A, also known as all-trans-retinoic-acid, or tretinoin (sold as Retin-A), that has been widely proven to improve skin appearance. The only problem is that it may kill you. “Topical Tretinoin Therapy and All-Cause Mortality”, a randomized controlled trial had to be stopped early, because significantly more people were dying in the retinoic acid group, compared to the placebo-cream group. When applied topically, 1 to 8 percent is absorbed into the bloodstream. Could it be killing people? While the debate continues as to whether the increase in deaths was just some statistical fluke or a real biological effect, tretinoin continues to be banned in Europe for cosmetic purposes. So, what can we use? Topical niacinamide, also known as nicotinamide, is described as one of the best-studied anti-aging skin cream ingredients (which is not saying much), but it has been shown to reduce yellowing, wrinkling, blotchiness, and dark spots in aging facial skin, for example, significantly reducing crow’s feet wrinkles around the eyes. This was a split-face study in which 64 percent of the niacinamide-side eye wrinkles had moderate or marked improvement, compared to zero percent of the placebo-side eyes. Topical vitamin C also offers similar improvements over placebo in wrinkles, sallowness, and skin tone or firmness. Unfortunately, vitamin C is unstable in creams, turning an unsightly brown when it oxidizes, limiting its shelf life. So instead, what the skin care industry does, the skin care industry, they use the stable vitamin C esters or derivatives, but there’s no evidence that these compounds have comparable effects, likely because they’re poorly absorbed and only minimally convert to the active form. But the good news is you can make your own. The 10 percent solution used in the study retails for a ridiculous $127 an ounce (30 ml), but you can make a DIY solution more than two thousand times cheaper by simply buying ascorbic acid in bulk and mixing three grams into 30 grams of water, at a cost of about a nickel per ounce (30 ml). Drip a few drops into the palm of your hand and use your fingertips to apply it over your face, neck, and upper chest daily. (Just don’t get it in your eyes.) And look, you can do the same thing with niacinamide, which can be even more ridiculously priced. But you can buy it in bulk as well, at a 5,000 percent discount. I can go on and on, and the book certainly does, but let me close out by going back to the basics. From the anti-aging journal Rejuvenation Research: “Finally, a regimen to extend human life expectancy.” Was it some exotic new stem cell treatment or gene therapy? No, it was a reference to this Harvard analysis. More than a hundred thousand men and women were followed for decades, and even just a few basic lifestyle behaviors appeared to translate into 12 to 14 extra years for the average 50-year-old. Even at age 50, you may be able to add an extra dozen years to your lifespan. Even at age 70, there could still be about ten extra years on the table. And if you clean up your life before 50, nearly 18 years may be up-for-grabs, based on simple common-sense behaviors. That’s the kind of life extension extrapolating from some of these lab animal experiments, but after decades of research and hundreds of millions of dollars later, efforts to translate those results into humans have largely been in vain. Yet, here we are with human data suggesting dramatic life extension is available to all of us. Right here, right now. The trillion-dollar pill that anti-aging biotech has been promising us is here, it just effectively has to be administered in the produce aisle and the gym. Turning back the clock, not with a drug or a DeLorean, but just by eating and living more healthfully. A midlife shift between the ages of 45 and 64 to even the barest of minimums, the barest of minimums. So, what are we talking about? At least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day, walking even just 20 minutes a day, maintaining a healthy weight, and not smoking, can result in a substantial reduction in mortality even in the immediate future. We’re talking a 40 percent lower risk of dying in the subsequent four years. The researchers conclude that making the necessary changes to adhere to a healthy lifestyle is extremely worthwhile, and middle-age is certainly not too late to act. You hold the power.

A national survey found that a ""vast majority"" of Americans trying to control their weight believed that food and beverage consumption and physical activity were equally important. Seven out of ten went with equally important, about two out of ten thought exercise was more important, and only about one out of ten chose diet. The vast majority of Americans are wrong. It's easy to understand how people might think diet and exercise play equal roles. After all, our weight is determined by the balance of calories in and calories out. What people may not understand about this energy balance equation is we have much more power over the ""calories in"" side. In fact, on a day-to-day basis we have full control, we could choose to eat zero calories or 10,000 calories. But most of the ""calories out"" tend to be outside of our control. Unlike wild animals who tend to burn most of their calories on activity, about 60 percent of our daily calories are used up just to keep us alive, what's called our resting, or basal, metabolic rate, thanks in part to our energy-intensive brains. Even if you stayed in bed all day, you'd still burn more than 1,000 calories just to fuel the basics like thinking, breathing, keeping your heart pumping. In contrast, even most ""active"" people accrue less than two hours of exercise a week, which may average out to be less than 100 calories burned off each day. That's only about 5 percent of the total daily energy expenditure, the ""calories out"" side of the equation. So, the 2,000 calories we may take in every day from our diet can exert 20 times more influence than exercise over our weight destiny. Most people believe that exercise is ""very effective"" as a way to lose weight, but this has been referred to as a myth in the scientific literature. In fact, it's been labeled one of the most common misconceptions in the field of obesity. Yet virtually all formal weight-loss guidelines include some sort of physical activity recommendation. Can you outrun a bad diet? Let's see what the science says. Population studies have certainly found strong correlations between physical inactivity and obesity. But does a sedentary lifestyle lead to obesity, or does obesity lead to a sedentary lifestyle? It probably works a little bit in both directions. To prove cause and effect, and also quantify the relationship, you really have to put it to the test. Dozens of randomized controlled trials involving thousands of participants have been published on the effects of exercise on weight loss. Physical activity was not found to be an effective strategy. For example, if you look at the studies that tried using exercise alone to induce weight loss, over an average of about five months, people only lost about three pounds. When you put all the studies together, it looks like it took around six weeks of exercising to get people to lose a single pound. That was exercise alone, though. What about as an adjunct to diet? If you randomize people into a diet and exercise intervention versus just the diet alone, the added exercise group does do better, but the difference in weight loss only averaged about two pounds. The studies lasted between 3 and 12 months, and all of that extra prescribed exercise only seemed to translate into a few pounds. The two-pound difference was statistically significant, which means we're pretty sure it was a real effect, but losing two pounds over a year's time can hardly be considered clinically significant. As a general rule, researchers like to see at least a five- or six-pound drop. In a meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials lasting a minimum of six months, the diet-plus-exercise group failed to significantly beat out the diet-only group at all. There appeared to be no long-term benefit to encouraging people to add exercise to their weight-loss regimen. What is going on? Maybe exercise is just better at preventing people from regaining weight. No. The vast majority of randomized controlled trials examining weight-loss maintenance also failed to show an exercise benefit. Part of the problem is compliance. It's one thing to tell people to adhere to an exercise regimen; it's another thing for them to actually do it. When the same randomized controlled trials were re-analyzed to exclude people who flouted the instructions, and analysis was limited to just those who actually put in the time and sweat, a clear advantage to exercise emerges. Exercise only works if you actually do it, though one reason people may become rapidly disillusioned with their new gym membership is their gross overestimation of the capacity of exercise to burn off extra calories. A slice of pizza has about 300 calories. That converts into an hour of brisk walking per slice, an hour a slice! How many kids are jogging two hours a day to burn off their happy meals? Who's got time to climb 50 flights of stairs to take care of the calories in just one Oreo cookie? That's one of the reasons that what we put in our mouths is most important. Public health researchers have been experimenting with including labeling on junk food. Which label is more informative? This one or these? Still want that Toblerone if it means you have to walk two hours? Or cookies you'd have to skip rope for 81 minutes for? I think I'd run an hour just to avoid having to eat shrimp-flavored potato chips. Labeling fast food menus with little pictograms of exercising stick figures was found to help nudge people towards lower calorie options. Seeing that the decision to supersize your fries would mean walking an extra three miles that day or that choosing the chicken salad over the garden salad could mean having to run nearly three miles, people are more likely to make the healthier choice."
