In other words, in the peer-reviewed medical literature, and that is what I’m here for. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today we explore the possibilities of how we might have control over our own death— retaining dignity, privacy, and pain relief. And we start with a close look at hospice.

And that’s where most people die. In spite of widespread preference to die at home, in almost all populations, most deaths occur in institutions. And this doesn’t just have consequences for the patient, but for the', metadata={'videoId': '7niWR9iARhE', 'title': 'Podcast: How to Die a Good Death', 'description': \"Retaining dignity, privacy, and relief from pain at the end of life.
