      "Yes, eating eggs can affect diabetes management and increase the risk of developing diabetes. Research has shown a stepwise increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes with higher egg consumption. Eating just a single egg a week may increase the odds of developing diabetes by 76%, and consuming two eggs a week appeared to double the odds. Furthermore, eating one egg a day was found to triple the odds of diabetes. This association between egg consumption and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes has been confirmed across various populations, including studies conducted in Asia and Europe.\n",

      "Additionally, for individuals who already have diabetes, consuming eggs may worsen their condition. Eating one egg a day or more has been associated with a shortened lifespan and may double the all-cause mortality rate for those with diabetes. These findings align with dietary guidelines that recommend restricting egg consumption to prevent cardiometabolic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\n",

      "The recommended daily adequate intake of water for children varies by age. For children ages 4 through 8, it's about 7 cups a day. For ages 9 through 13, it's 8 cups a day for girls and 10 cups for boys. These recommendations may offer more than just hydration benefits, as they are associated with increased metabolic rates in some studies. However, not all research teams were able to replicate these findings.\n",
