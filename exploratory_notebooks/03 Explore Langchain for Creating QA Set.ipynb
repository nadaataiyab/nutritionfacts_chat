lettuce we have a natural inborn preference for sweet starchy fatty foods because that\\'s where the calories are concentrated think about hunting and Gathering efficiency uh we used to have to work hard for our food prehistorically it doesn\\'t make sense to spend all day collecting types of food that on average don\\'t provide at least a day\\'s worth of calories right you would have been better off staying back in the cave right so we evolved to Crave foods with the biggest caloric bang for their buck if we were able to steadily Forge a pound of food an hour and it had 250 calories per pound it might take you you know 10 hours just to break even on your calories for the day but if you were gathering something with 500 calories a pound you could be done in five hours and spend the next five practicing your wall paintings so the greater the energy density the more calories per pound the more efficient the foraging so we developed an acute ability to discriminate Foods based on calorie density and to instinctively desire the densest if you study the fruit and vegetable consumption of four-year-old children they\\'re liking correlates with calorie density they prefer bananas over berries carrots over cucumbers well I mean duh isn\\'t that just a preference for sweetness no they also prefer potatoes over peaches and green beans over melon just like you know monkeys prefer avocados over bananas we appear to have this inborn drive to maximize calories per mouthful all the foods that researchers tested were naturally less than 500 calories per pound uh bananas topped the chart at about 400. something funny happens when you start going over that we lose our ability to differentiate over the natural range of calorie densities we have this uncanny aptitude to pick out the subtle distinctions however once you start heading towards you know bacon cheese and chocolate territory which can reach you know thousands of calories per pound our perception has become relatively numb to the differences no wonder since these Foods were unknown to our prehistoric Brains it\\'s like the dodo bird failing to evolve a fear response because they had no natural predators and we all know how that turned out or sea turtle hatchlings crawling in the wrong direction towards artificial light rather than the moon aberrant Behavior explained by an evolutionary mismatch the food industry exploits our innate biological vulnerabilities by by stripping crops down into almost pure calories straight sugar oil which is pretty much pure fat and white flour it\\'s mostly refined starch right at first they have to remove the fiber because it effectively has zero calories run brown rice through a mill to make white and you lose about two-thirds of the fiber turn whole wheat flour into white and lose 75 or you can run crops through animals to make meat eggs and dairy and remove a hundred percent of the fiber right and what you\\'re left with is crap an acronym used by one of my favorite dietitians Jeff Novick calorie rich and processed foods calories are condensed in the same way plants are turned into addictive drugs like opiates and cocaine concentration crystallization distillation and extraction they even appear to activate the same reward Pathways in the brain put people with food addiction and MRI scanner show them a picture of a chocolate milkshake and the areas that light up in their brains are the same is when cocaine addicts are shown a video on crack smoking food addiction is a misnomer and people don\\'t suffer out of control eating behaviors to food in general right we don\\'t tend to compulsively crave carrots right and milkshakes are packed with sugar and fat two of the signals to our brains of calorie density when people are asked to rate different foods in terms of cravings and loss of control most incriminated with a load of crap highly processed foods like donuts along with cheese and meat those least related to problematic eating behaviors fruits and vegetables calorie density may be the reason people don\\'t get up in the middle of the night and binge on broccoli animals don\\'t tend to get fat when they\\'re eating the foods they were designed tea now there is a confirmed report of Free Living primates becoming obese but that was a troop of baboons who evidently stumbled across some dumpsters at a tourist Lodge the garbage feeding animals weighed 50 more than their wild feeding counterparts sadly we can suffer the same mismatched fate and become obese eating garbage too for

An unlikely candidate to launch a lifestyle medicine revolution, he wasn’t a doctor, wasn’t a dietician. He was an engineer. And so, when he got diagnosed with heart disease in his 40s, he was not satisfied with the medical profession’s fatalism. This was, after all, a time when doctors still preferred Camels. So, he did his own research. He experimented. He studied the diets of cultures around the world— particularly Uganda—and finally arrived at a plant-based diet, dropping his cholesterol from 280 down to 94, reversing his own heart disease, before going on to do the same for thousands of others, before he tragically lost his 28-year battle with radiation-induced leukemia. Before he died, though, he directed that his body be autopsied. He wanted to show the world what his diet could do. The autopsy findings were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Thirty years after his original heart disease diagnosis, considered incurable at the time, his coronary arteries were found to be soft and pliable, and widely patent throughout. “In a man 69 years old, the near absence of atherosclerosis and complete absence of its effects are remarkable.”\\n\\nvideoID: EvcYy8_bCx0 \\n Transcript: \"Soul Food That’s Good for the Soul\" The burden of cardiovascular disease in the African American community remains high and is a primary cause of disparities in life expectancy between African Americans and whites. Why is there such an excess burden? Because of an excess burden of risk factors, for example, high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol. And what’s underlying those risk factors? Much can be traced back to diet. Among the ethnic groups, the proportions of people meeting healthy diet recommendations were generally lowest among Blacks. In this national survey, most Black Americans were found to be eating a particularly poor diet, as defined by the American Heart Association. African Americans may face unique challenges to adherence to dietary recommendations, and one such challenge is an alignment with a cultural tradition of “soul food.” Now some soul food components are fantastic. You can’t get much healthier than collard greens and sweet potatoes, tomatoes, legumes (dried peas and beans like black-eyed peas), watermelon, blackberries, corn, and okra. It’s all making me hungry. But conversely, soul food can also be high in added fats, sugars, and salt, with prominent use of high-fat meats not to mention the use of deep frying. So, like fried chicken and chitlins, which are pig intestines, foods that can be high in sodium and saturated fat— dietary factors linked to chronic disease. Where did the pig intestines custom come from? You have to trace the roots. Soul food is what the enslaved Africans were forced to come up with in the Deep South to survive during slavery. That’s in stark contrast to traditional West African diets where they come from, which were predominantly plant-based, centered on a foundation of greens and fruits and legumes and nuts and vegetables, and whole grains, and even more vegetables. However, these traditions have been westernized, bastardized into a diet high in fried foods, sweetened beverages, and red and processed meats. But the good news is more and more African Americans are adopting plant-based diets to combat their health problems, helped by a growing movement of vegan soul food restaurants that serve healthier, plant-based meals. Soul food scholar Adrian Miller even wrote that after eating his way across the country, it was clear to him that soul food’s creative energy burns brightest in restaurants that are targeting upscale, vegetarian, or vegan clientele. Are they reaching the people who need it most, though? Well, they do tend to be located in higher African American, higher poverty areas. A signiﬁcant number of restaurants were classiﬁed in food desert zones, where there’s a dearth of supermarkets, implying their potential to provide healthier meals to residents in the surrounding neighborhoods. Therefore, having more vegan soul food restaurants and growing movements centered on Black veganism, may provide opportunities to inﬂuence the nutrition habits in the African American community, especially since some are even able to offer cooking classes. So, establishing public health partnerships with vegan soul food restaurants to get more African American adults to eat plant-based foods could be a promising first step in reducing some of the Black/white health disparities. “We’re not meat shamers,” said owners of vegan soul food restaurants promoting healthy eating in the African American community. “We’re plant pushers,” trying to tie the best of soul food’s origins to a fourteenth century plant-centric West African diet, in hopes of making people feel that being vegan is in fact a legitimate part of Black culture and Black identity. Even potentially tying into the concept of social justice, in an attempt to reverse the eﬀects of targeted marketing eﬀorts by fast food companies to children in communities of color. This movement has been helped by a plant-positive who\\'s who of Black culture, not just luminaries like like Coretta Scott King and Cory Booker, but the likes of NBA stars, Samuel L. Jackson, and Beyoncé, and influentially the late activist Dick Gregory, known in popular culture as a comedian, but was also an outspoken vegan health advocate influenced by Alvenia Fulton who imagined soul food that was actually good for the soul. Instead of celebrating the fact that slaveholders denied enslaved people access to quality foods, she persuaded Black communities to view food as an agent of health and healing, advocating fresh, whole foods as the path to alleviating or reversing the crippling burden of chronic disease. Black vegetarians and vegans are showing a plant-based diet isn’t just for white people— and never was. In fact, you can go back centuries to The Liberator back in the 1800s, the abolitionist publication where William Lloyd Garrison wrote in his famous essay: \"I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice.\" Well, in an 1853 issue, it was written that: “A man whose stomach is crammed with animal abominations… can no more appreciate lofty moral and intellectual teachings, than a swine can appreciate pearl necklaces. Logic, humor, and eloquence are wasted on such persons.” \"If only the American people took more thought what they should eat and drink, obeying the rules impressed upon them by experience and science,\" (by which they meant a vegetarian diet), (America) \"would be half-converted to Anti-Slavery, Peace, Temperance, Land Reform, Woman’s Rights, etc., in a single year.\"\\n\\nvideoID: Ka_ngjez9dA \\n Transcript: “Atkins Diet: Trouble Keeping It Up” Remember the Atkins Diet? I wrote a book about it a few years ago. The Atkins Corporation threatened to sue me, but I kind of won by default, because they declared bankruptcy six months later. You can read the whole book, and my rather amusing back-and-forth with Atkins’ lawyers, at atkinsexposed.org/. Here’s an illustrative case report of what can happen when you go on such a diet, reported recently in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association: “Development of Symptomatic Cardiovascular disease after Self-Reported Adherence to the Atkins Diet.” Started out healthy; 51-year-old man, pretty good cholesterol, no chest pain, and a working penis. He was gaining a few pounds, though, so he decided to go on a low-carb diet. One month in, his cholesterol shot through the roof, but hey, he lost five pounds, so, he kept it up. And after two years more on the diet, he lost three pounds, but he also lost the ability to have an erection. And, he started having chest pains. But hey, that’s what drugs are for, so he started taking Viagra, one of the wonders of modern medicine, which also came in handy when he landed in the emergency room with crushing chest pain. He got a cardiac catheterization which found a 99% blockage of one of his coronary arteries supplying blood to his heart. Luckily, they found it in time. He got a drug-eluding stent placed. He was eventually discharged from the hospital, and finally decided, you know, maybe this Atkins thing isn’t such a great idea, so he switched to a low-fat diet with greens, whole grains, beans, vegetables, nuts, and even (gasp!) “the inclusion of vegetarian entrees.” Two months on the new diet, his weight was down, his cholesterol was down, and he stopped taking the Viagra. Now, a skeptic might suggest that he had clogged arteries before he even started the low-carb diet. But no, he actually got a coronary artery scan right before starting on Atkins, and there was no measurable plaque in his coronary arteries. And then, just 29 months later, after the initiation of the low-carb diet, 99% blockage. Now they were able to open that surgically with a stent, but it took his changing to a more healthy diet to open up blood flow to other parts of his body.\\n\\nvideoID: Vlr7aXD5hqI \\n Transcript: \"How to Test for Functional Vitamin B12 Deficiency\" Two cases of young, strictly vegetarian individuals with no known vascular risk factors, yet suffering a stroke or multiple strokes. Why? Most probably because they weren\\'t taking vitamin B12 supplements, which leads to high homocysteine levels, which can attack your arteries. So those eating plant-based failing to supplement may increase one\\'s risk of both heart disease and stroke. Now vegetarians have so much heart disease risk factor benefit that they\\'re still at lower risk overall, but this may help explain why vegetarians were found to have more stroke. Presumably this disparity would disappear with adequate B12 supplementation, and this benefit would grow even larger. Compared with non-vegetarians, vegetarians enjoy all these other advantages: better cholesterol, blood pressures, blood sugars, and obesity rates. But, like what about that stroke study? And even among studies that show benefits, they\\'re not as pronounced as one might expect, which may be a result of the poor vitamin B12 status. Vitamin B12 deficiency may negate some of the cardiovascular disease prevention benefits of vegetarian diets, so in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, vegetarians should be advised to use B12 supplements. How can you determine your B12 status? By the time you\\'re symptomatic with B12 deficiency, it\\'s too late. And initially the symptoms can be so subtle that you might even miss them. And well before you develop clinical deficiency, you develop metabolic vitamin B12 deficiency: a missed opportunity to prevent strokes, where you have enough  B12 to avoid deficiency symptoms, but not enough to keep your homocysteine in check. Underdiagnosis of the condition results largely from failure to understand that a normal B12 blood level may not reflect adequate functional B12 status. The levels of B12 in your blood does not always represent the levels of B12 in your cells. You can have a severe functional deficiency of B12 even though your blood levels are normal or even high. Most physicians tend to assume that if the B12 level in your blood is normal, then there\\'s no problem. But  within the lower range of normal, 30% of patients could have metabolic B12 deficiency with high homocysteine levels. Measuring methylmalonic acid levels or homocysteine directly are a more accurate reflection of vitamin B12 functional status. Methylmalonic acid can be a simple urine test; you\\'re looking for less than a value of 4 micrograms per milligram of creatinine. Elevated MMA is a specific marker of vitamin B12 deficiency, while homocysteine rises in  the context of both vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and so metabolic B12 deficiency is defined by an elevation in MMA levels or by an elevation of homocysteine in people getting enough folate. Even without eating beans and greens, which are packed with folate, folic acid is added to the flour supply by law. And so high homocysteine levels these days may be mostly a B12 problem. Ideally, you\\'re looking for a homocysteine level in your blood down in the single digits. Measured this way, the prevalence of functional B12 deficiency is dramatically higher than previously assumed, like 10%-40% of the general population, and more than 40% in vegetarians, and the majority of vegans who aren\\'t scrupulous about getting their B12. Some suggest that those on plant-based diets check their vitamin B12 status every year, but you shouldn\\'t need to if you\\'re adequately supplementing. And evidently, there are rare cases of vitamin B12 deficiency that can\\'t be picked up on any test, so better to just make sure you\\'re getting enough. Now, if you do get your homocysteine tested and it\\'s still up in the double digits even despite B12 supplementation, I do have a suggestion in the final videos of this series, which we\\'ll turn to next.\\n\\nvideoID: 5A0ChIZsdHY \\n Transcript: \"Does Fiber Really Prevent Diverticulosis?\" A study out of the University of North Carolina found no association between dietary fiber intake and diverticulosis in comparing the group that ate the highest amount, 25 grams, three times the amount of the lowest fiber intake group. They concluded that a low fiber diet is not associated with diverticulosis. The university sent out a press release: \"Diets high in fiber won\\'t protect against diverticulosis.\" The press picked it up. \"Study finds high fiber diet may not protect against diverticulosis.\" Went all over the Paleo blogs, and even medical journals: an important paper calling into question the fiber theory of the development of diverticulosis. Other editorials, though, caught the critical flaw. To understand this, let\\'s turn to another dietary deficiency disease, scurvy. Medical experiments on prisoners in Iowa State Penitentiary showed that clinical signs of scurvy start appearing just 29 days without vitamin C. Experiments on pacifists during World War II showed the same thing, that it takes about 10 mg of vitamin C a day to prevent scurvy. So imagine going back in time a few centuries, when they were still trying to figure scurvy out. Dr. James Linde had this radical theory that citrus fruits could cure scurvy. What if an experiment was designed to test this crazy theory, in which sailors were given the juice of either one wedge of lemon, or three wedges of lemons a day. If a month later on the high seas there was no difference in scurvy rates, one might see headlines like this. The printing press pamphleteers would all be touting the study that found that a low vitamin C diet is not associated with scurvy. See, a wedge of lemon only yields about 2mg of vitamin C, and it takes 10 to prevent scurvy. So they would have been comparing 2mg a day to like three times that, 7mg -- one vitamin C deficiency dose versus another vitamin C deficiency dose. No wonder there would be no difference in scurvy rates. We evolved eating so many plants that we likely averaged around 600mg of vitamin C a day. That\\'s what our bodies are biologically used to getting. What about fiber? How much fiber are we used to getting? Over a hundred grams a day. The highest fiber intake group in the North Carolina study was only eating 25, which is less than the minimum recommended daily allowance, which is about 32 grams. They didn\\'t even make the minimum. So they compared one fiber deficient diet to another fiber deficient diet. No wonder there was no difference in diverticulosis rates. The African populations, where they had essentially no diverticulosis, ate diets consisting in part of  large platefuls of leafy vegetables, similar perhaps to what we were eating a few million years ago. They were eating plant-based diets containing 70 to 90 grams of fiber a day. Most vegetarians don\\'t even eat that many whole plant foods, though some do. At least they hit the minimum mark, and had less diverticulosis to show for it. This was a relatively small study though. 35 years later, 47,000 people were studied, confirming that consuming a vegetarian diet and a high intake of dietary fiber were both associated with a lower risk of both hospitalization and death from diverticular disease. And they had enough people to tease it out. Compared to those eating a single serving of meat a day or more, those that had less than half a serving appeared to have a 16% lower risk; pescetarians - no meat except some fish - down 23%, though neither statistically significant. But eating vegetarian was: 35% lower risk. And those eating strictly plant-based appeared to be at 78% lower risk. As with all lifestyle interventions,  it only works if you do it. High fiber diets only work if they’re actually high fiber.\\n\\nvideoID: K64v_V2Z3QE \\n Transcript: \"Diverticulosis: When Our Most Common Gut Disorder Hardly Existed\" Diverticula are out-pouchings from our intestine. Doctors like using a tire analogy, high pressures within the gut can force the intestines to balloon out through weak spots in the intestinal wall like an inner tube poking out through a worn tire tread. This is what they actually look like. These pockets can become inflamed and infected, and, to carry the tire analogy further, can blow out, spilling fecal matter into the abdomen or the bladder and lead to death. Symptoms can range from no symptoms at all, to a little cramping and bloating, to incapacitating pain that is a medical emergency. 9 of out 10 people that die from the disease never even knew they had it. But the good news is that there may be a way to prevent the disease. Diverticular disease is the most common intestinal disorder, affecting up to 70% of people by age 60. If it’s that common, though, maybe it’s just an inevitable consequence of aging? No, it’s a new disease. In 1907, 25 cases had been reported in the medical literature. Not in 25% of people but 25 cases period. And they’re kind of hard to miss on autopsy. A hundred years ago, in 1916, it didn’t even merit mention in medical and surgical textbooks. The mystery wasn’t solved until 1971. How did a disease that was almost unknown become the most common affliction of the colon in the Western world within one lifespan? Surgeons Painter and Burkitt suggested diverticulosis was a deficiency disease, a disease caused by a deficiency of fiber. In the late 1800s, roller milling was introduced - further removing fiber from grain and we started to fill up on fiber deficient foods like meat and sugar. A few decades of this and diverticulosis was rampant. This is what they thought was going on. Just as it would be easy to squeeze a lump of butter through a bicycle tube, it’s easy to move large soft, moist intestinal contents through the gut. In contrast, try squeezing through a lump of tar. When we eat fiber deficient diets our feces can be become small and firm, and so our intestines have to really squeeze hard to move it along, and this buildup of pressure may force out those bulges. And eventually, a low-fiber diet can then sometimes lead to the colon literally \\'rupturing\\' itself. If this theory is true, then populations that eat high fiber diets would have low rates of diverticulosis. And that’s what’s been found. More than 50% of African Americans in their 50’s were found to have diverticulosis, compared to less than 1% in African Africans, eating traditional plant-based diets. And by less than 1%, we’re talking zero out of a series of 2000 autopsies, two out of 4,000 in Uganda. That’s like a thousand times lower prevalence. What then, about this newer study concluding that a low fiber diet was NOT associated with diverticulosis. We’ll cover that, next.\\n\\nvideoID: kYMbK4pMYNo \\n Transcript: \"Diverticulosis & Nuts\" Still, nuts are the best source of fat— but what if you have diverticulosis? Doctors typically tell  patients with diverticulosis that they should avoid nuts. Diverticulosis is a disease caused  by inadequate dietary fiber intake. Just as if you don’t get enough  vitamin C, you can develop scurvy, if you don’t get enough fiber, you can develop diverticulosis— which are outpouchings from your colon. When we don’t eat enough fiber every  day to soften and bulk up our stool, we may have to strain  during a bowel movement. And after a lifetime of straining, you can literally blow out  these pockets from your colon. More than half of older  Americans have diverticulosis, because people don’t eat  enough whole plant foods— the only place fiber is found. This is what they  look like on the inside. This is what they look  like on the outside. This should be a smooth round tube. And if one of these offshoot  blow-out tunnels gets inflamed, it looks more like this, and this. You don’t have to be a doctor to realize that’s not what our  colon should look like. And if we keep it up,  it can eat right through, and we can blow a hole  in our colon and die— all because we ate too many  refined foods and animals, and not enough whole plants. But, back to the original  question, though. Sometimes, on autopsy,  you can find nuts, seeds, or pieces of corn or popcorn  stuck in those pockets— which led to this theory that they may  be what triggered the inflammation. So the conventional wisdom has been to tell elderly folks to stay  away from these foods. But at the same time, the lack of plant foods caused the  whole problem in the first place— so do we really want to  tell people to cut down? Well, what does the latest research show? Stay away from these foods: fact or fiction? According to a landmark new study in the Journal of the  American Medical Association, not only fiction, but those with diverticulosis  eating nuts and popcorn had lower rates of inflammation.'"
