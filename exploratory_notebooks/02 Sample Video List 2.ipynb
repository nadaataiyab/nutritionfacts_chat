I addressed those in my B12 webinar, and the videos are available for download here or on NutritionFacts.org (https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/).

       "  'What are the best green-light (whole food plant-based) sources of vitamin B12?\\n\\nThe reason you have to take most B12-fortified foods three times a day is because it takes your B12 receptors at least about 4 hours to unload their cargo and be ready for the next tiny dose. At huge doses, like in the supplements and Leafside you actually end up largely bypassing the receptor system so you can do once a day (and for big enough supplemental doses once a week), but for the tiny amounts found in most fortified foods, like the nutritional yeast, and breakfast cereals, and plant-based meats and milks you have to get that 190% in three separate servings throughout the day.\\n\\nI mentioned a few nutritional yeast brands in the video. Here are a few more with their serving sizes for B12 content:\\n• Lotus (Australia & New Zealand): 1 tsp 3x/day\\n• Marigold Engevita (UK): 2 tsp 3x/day\\n• Anthony’s Premium (Canada): 1 tsp 3x/day\\n• Hoosier Hill Farm (Canada): 1 tsp 3x/day\\n\\nThis is the third in a five-part video series on B12.

Instead of trying to reschedule again, I decided to record the presentation so you could get the information as soon as possible! \\n\\nYou may have heard about a new study suggesting that an enzyme in bananas called polyphenol oxidase—the enzyme that turns bananas brown—can destroy a class of nutrients found in foods like berries. So, should you stop putting bananas in your smoothies? Is there anything we can add to the smoothie to counter the banana enzyme’s effects? Is it just a smoothie thing? What about eating a banana with meals?\\n\\nAnd what about other fruits and vegetables that turn brown that also have this enzyme, like white potatoes, avocados, and white mushrooms? Is the enzyme destroyed by cooking?

In addition to the wealth of recommendations found throughout How Not to Age, this section is designed to highlight specific foods, supplements, or behaviors that have the potential to offer the best opportunities to slow aging or improve longevity.\\n\\nFirst on my list of the Anti-Aging Eight: Nuts.\\n\\nInterventional trials have shown that eating nuts improves artery function. Nuts may also improve blood sugar control, lower cholesterol, suppress inflammation, reduce oxidative stress, and feed our friendly gut flora. Raw nuts are preferred over salted or toasted ones, and whole or chopped nuts over nut butters.\\n\\nIncluding nuts, especially walnuts, as part of a whole food, plant-based diet may be just one of eight ways we can improve our health and longevity. My Daily Dozen recommends at least one serving of nuts or other seeds every day. A quarter cup of nuts is considered a serving.\\nPreorder your copy of How Not to Age today at https://see.nf/preorder.\\n\\nWatch the video \"Do the Health Benefits of Peanut Butter Include Longevity?\" at https://bit.ly/3EgQ7sF.

       " ('Friday Favorites: Cut the Calorie-Rich-And-Processed Foods',\n",
       "  'We have an uncanny ability to pick out the subtle distinctions in calorie density of foods, but only within the natural range.\\n\\nA key insight I want to emphasize here is the concept of animal products as the ultimate processed food. Basically, all nutrition grows from the ground: seeds, sunlight, and soil. That’s where all our vitamins come from, all our minerals, all the protein (all the essential amino acids). The only reason there are essential amino acids in a steak is because the cow ate them all from plants. They’re essential—we can’t make them, and the animals can’t make them either. They have to eat plants to get them. But we can cut out the middlemoo and get nutrition directly from the Earth, and, in doing so, get all the phytonutrients and fiber that are lost when plants are processed through animals. Even ultra-processed junk foods may have a tiny bit of fiber still left, but all is lost when plants are ultra-ultra-processed through animals.\\n\\nHaving said that, there was also a big jump in what one would traditionally think of as processed foods, and that’s the topic of this video: The Role of Processed Foods in the Obesity Epidemic (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-processed-foods-in-the-obesity-epidemic).\\n\\nFor more on n the cause of the obesity epidemic, check out:\\n• The Role of Diet vs. Exercise in the Obesity Epidemic (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-diet-vs-exercise-in-the-obesity-epidemic)\\n• The Role of Genes in the Obesity Epidemic (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-genes-in-the-obesity-epidemic/)\\n• The Thrifty Gene Theory: Survival of the Fattest (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-thrifty-gene-theory-survival-of-the-fattest)\\n\\nIf you’re familiar with my work, you know that I recommend eating a variety of whole plant foods, as close to the way nature intended. I capture this in my Daily Dozen Checklist, which you can download for free here (https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen-challenge/), or get the free app on iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dr.-gregers-daily-dozen/id1060700802?mt=8) and Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nutritionfacts.dailydozen).

If increasing your salt sensitivity was all tongue scraping did, then that alone would make the practice worthwhile, even if you already have fantastic breath and even if your blood pressure is pristine. Excess sodium does more damage than just increase our blood pressure. So, anything we can do to make food taste saltier so we add less salt, the better. \\n\\nIn terms of technique, do it daily and do it gently, just along the top surface, but make sure to include the back of the tongue. The two preferred brands in the study I mentioned were meridol and “Scrapy.” Unfortunately, I think they’re both only sold in Europe, but, as I said, you can just use a simple spoon. And, in terms of sanitizing without worrying about a vinegary aftertaste, remember the microwave-for-one-minute trick and save yourself from having to keep buying toothbrushes.

       "  'Tongue scraping can boost the ability of the good bacteria in our mouth to take advantage of the nitrates in greens to improve our cardiovascular health.\\n\\nThere was so much juicy stuff packed into a single video! Let me emphasize some of the key points. I have tons of videos about our microbiome, but, normally, I’m mostly only talking about the gut microbiome. We have a skin microbiome, good and bad bugs that live on our skin and affect conditions like acne and eczema, for instance. We have a microbiome in our ear canals, living in our ear wax. And, yes, we have an oral microbiome that doesn’t just determine the health of our gums and teeth, but it also has systemic consequences, converting the nitrates in beets and green leafy vegetables into the “open sesame”  nitric oxide molecule that allows our arteries to relax and dilate open. \\n\\nIt’s a team effort. When you hear Dr. Esselstyn talk about the miracle of nitric oxide for your heart and how heart patients should eat greens six times a day, yes, yes, yes! But, you can’t take full advantage of all of those greens without these good bacteria on your tongue. That’s why antibacterial mouthwash is such a bad idea and why antibacterial mouthwash is not the way to deal with bad breath, because, when you use it, you’re killing your nitric oxide-producing bugs, too. If you never eat vegetables, it doesn’t matter much either way, but if you want to keep the good bugs happy, follow these three tips:\\n\\n1. Don’t use antibacterial mouthwash.\\n2. Eat a plant-based diet because vegans have more of the good bugs.\\n3. Tongue scrape every day, as regular tongue cleaning boosts the good bacteria, too. \\n\\nLet’s get to the nitty gritty. What is the best way to clean your tongue? That’s the topic of the last video in this series: How to Clean Your Tongue (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-to-clean-your-tongue).\\n\\nIf you missed any of the first three videos, see:\\n• Effects of Tongue Scraping on Plaque, Gingivitis, and Cavities (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/effects-of-tongue-scraping-on-plaque-gingivitis-and-cavities)\\n• Tongue Scraping vs. Tongue Brushing for Treating Halitosis (Bad Breath) (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/tongue-scraping-vs-tongue-brushing-for-treating-halitosis-bad-breath)\\n• Does Tongue Scraping Cause Cancer?

It’s the same reason you should never put Vaseline or another petroleum jelly inside your nostrils: When you lie back at night, it drips down into your lungs. For more, see The Risks of Oil Pulling (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-risks-of-oil-pulling/).\\n\\nAnyway, is tongue scraping legit?

I want it to be a practical guide on translating this mountain of data into day-to-day decisions. So, that’s where my Daily Dozen slips into the mix. It’s available for free on Apple App Store (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dr.-gregers-daily-dozen/id1060700802?mt=8) as well as an Android app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nutritionfacts.dailydozen), thanks to an amazing group of volunteers through our Open Source Initiative (https://nutritionfacts.org/open-source/).\\n\\nHere are direct links to the two videos I referenced in the video: How Many Glasses of Water Should We Drink a Day?

As devastating as COVID-19 has been, it may just be a dress rehearsal for an even greater threat waiting in the wings…of chickens.\\n\\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the leading candidate for the next pandemic is a bird flu virus known as H7N9, which is a hundred times deadlier than COVID-19. Instead of 1 in 250 patients dying, H7N9 has killed 40 percent of people it infects. \\n\\nThe last time a bird flu virus jumped directly to humans and caused a pandemic, it triggered the deadliest plague in human history—the 1918 pandemic that killed 50 million people. That had a 2 percent death rate. What if we had a pandemic infecting billions where death was closer to a flip of a coin?\\n\\nThe good news is there is something we can do about it. Just as eliminating the exotic animal trade and live animal markets may go a long way toward preventing the next coronavirus pandemic, reforming the way we raise domestic animals for food may help forestall the next killer flu.

Get yours here: https://nutritionfacts.org/subscribe/\\n\\nAt this point, you may be thinking what a shameful, dark period of medical history. Millions of risky procedures were performed, killing people and causing strokes before it was actually put to the test. When it finally was, it was proven to offer to no benefit. Certainly, a cautionary tale for the future. In fact, they’re still being done. It's still one of the most common invasive procedures performed in the United States.

       " ('Cut the Calorie-Rich-And-Processed Foods',\n",
       "  'We have an uncanny ability to pick out the subtle distinctions in calorie density of foods, but only within the natural range. Processed food interferes with this ability, encouraging weight gain.\\n\\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift. Get yours here: https://nutritionfacts.org/subscribe/\\n\\nA key insight I want to emphasize here is the concept of animal products as the ultimate processed food. Basically, all nutrition grows from the ground: seeds, sunlight, and soil. That’s where all our vitamins come from, all our minerals, all the protein (all the essential amino acids). The only reason there are essential amino acids in a steak is because the cow ate them all from plants. They’re essential—we can’t make them, and the animals can’t make them either. They have to eat plants to get them. But we can cut out the middlemoo and get nutrition directly from the Earth, and in doing so get all the phytonutrients and fiber that are lost when plants are processed through animals. Even ultraprocessed junk foods may have a tiny bit of fiber still left, but all is lost when plants are ultra-ultraprocessed through animals. \\n\\nHaving said that, there was also a big jump in what one would traditionally think of as processed foods, and that’s the video we turn to next: The Role of Processed Foods in the Obesity Epidemic (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-processed-foods-in-the-obesity-epidemic).\\n\\nWe’re making our way through a series on the cause of the obesity epidemic. So far, we’ve looked at exercise (The Role of Diet vs. Exercise in the Obesity Epidemic (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-role-of-diet-vs-exercise-in-the-obesity-epidemic)) and genes (The Role of Genes in the Obesity Epidemic (https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/the-role-of-genes-in-the-obesity-epidemic), The Thrifty Gene Theory: Survival of the Fattest(http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-thrifty-gene-theory-survival-of-the-fattest)). But really, it’s the food. \\n\\nIf you’re familiar with my work, you know that I recommend eating a variety of whole plant foods, as close to the way nature intended. I capture this in my Daily Dozen Checklist, which you can download for free here (https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen-challenge/), or get the free app on iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dr.-gregers-daily-dozen/id1060700802?mt=8) and Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nutritionfacts.dailydozen).

Was it inactivity—just kids sitting around playing video games? Was it genetic? Was it epigenetic—something turning our fat genes on? Or was it just the food? Were we eating more fat all of the sudden, more carbs? More processed foods? Or were we just eating more period, because of bigger serving sizes or just snacking more? Inquiring minds wanted to know.\\n\\nThis is the first in an 11-video series to answer this question, which I originally released in a 2-hour webinar earlier this year.

       "  'Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes are caused by a drop in insulin sensitivity blamed on “intramyocellular lipid,” the buildup of fat inside our muscle cells. Saturated fat can be toxic to the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas, explaining why animal fat consumption can impair insulin secretion, not just insulin sensitivity.\\n\\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift. Get yours here: https://nutritionfacts.org/subscribe/\\n\\nThis was the first of a three-part video series on the cause of type 2 diabetes, so as to better understand dietary interventions to prevent and treat the epidemic. The follow-up videos are The Spillover Effect Links Obesity to Diabetes (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-spillover-effect-links-obesity-to-diabetes), in which I talk about how that fat can come either from our diet or excess fat stores; and Lipotoxicity: How Saturated Fat Raises Blood Sugar (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/lipotoxicity-how-saturated-fat-raises-blood-sugar), where I show how not all fats are equally to blame.\\n\\nI mentioned low-carb diets in the video.

       "'In this 3-video series, I show the science behind the pros and cons of the flu vaccine, pneumonia vaccine, and shingles vaccine. \"Benefits and Side Effects of the Flu Vaccine\" Every year, influenza typically kills between 4,000 and 20,000 Americans, though the death toll for the 2017 to 2018 season was estimated at 80,000, making it one of the deadliest in the last half century. Most hospitalizations and 90 percent of flu-related mortality occur in those 65 and older, and most over the age of 75. Mortality rates for the flu at ages 75 and older are 50 times higher than those below age 65. Nonetheless, the CDC recommends everyone over the age of 6 months get a routine annual flu shot every year, if for no other reason than to help prevent transmission to the more vulnerable. The cruel irony is that older adults, the ones who need protection the most, acquire less robust protection from flu shots due to waning immunity with age. Depending on the season, vaccination typically reduces the risk of getting the flu by about 40 to 50 percent. So, in healthy adults, we can say with moderate certainty we can decrease the risk of getting it from like 2 percent each year down to just under 1 percent. Among older adults, even if you get a similar relative risk reduction, from 6 percent down to 2.4 percent, since the risk is higher and the consequences greater, the absolute benefits are greater too. In the Northern Hemisphere, the flu season can start as early as September and go as late as March. The problem with getting vaccinated too early in the season is that immunity might wane before the season is over, especially in older adults. So, it might be good to wait until October, but getting it at any time throughout the season is preferable to not getting vaccinated at all. Yes, the influenza vaccine can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome, an autoimmune attack on your nerves that can leave you paralyzed for weeks, but so too can getting the flu. There may be 1 to 2 additional cases of Guillain-Barré per million vaccinations versus about 17 extra cases per million contacts with the flu virus. So, you\\'re much more likely to be temporarily paralyzed by the flu than the flu shot, but since it takes vaccinating about 30 older people to prevent one case of the flu, getting vaccinated would still, in expectation, raise your overall Guillain-Barré risk. But the reason flu shots are recommended is not to lower risk of some obscure autoimmune syndrome but to reduce the common, and potentially devastating, impacts of the flu that extend well beyond just the respiratory infection. In the week following a confirmed flu infection, the risk of having a heart attack shoots up six-fold. The inflammation of infection can destabilize atherosclerotic plaques, constrict arteries, and make the blood more liable to clot. So, might flu vaccinations save lives in more ways than one? That\\'s why indirectly the flu may kill up to three times more. Those who get their flu shots are indeed less likely to die from cardiovascular disease in a given year as well as all causes put together. In other words, those who get regular flu shots live, on average, longer lives. But who disproportionally gets flu shots? White, married, nonsmokers of a higher social class, with higher education, higher incomes, and health insurance. You can\\'t tell if it\\'s truly cause-and-effect until you put it to the test. There have been four randomized controlled trials, flu shots versus placebo shots, in those with pre-existing heart disease, and overall, those who got the real shots had a 56 percent lower chance of dying from cardiovascular disease and a 47 percent lower chance of dying from all causes put together. So, flu shots really can be an extraordinary life-saver. Whether the observational data showing fewer deaths across the board, even among those without pre-existing heart disease, similarly pans out is, as of yet, unknown, but if you notice for secondary prevention the randomized controlled trials showed even more protection than the observational studies hinted at. Given the benefits, overcoming vaccine hesitancy should be as simple as correcting misinformation, but sadly, debunking vaccine myths may actually backfire. Busting the myth that inactivated flu shots, the type given to older adults, can give you the flu surprisingly makes people even less likely to get it. Similarly, correcting the falsehood that MMR vaccines cause autism or that pertussis vaccination causes as many side effects as people think paradoxically makes people less inclined to vaccinate. The researchers conclude \"correcting vaccine myths may not be an effective approach to promoting vaccination.\"'"
