       "Document(page_content='\"Eggs and Diabetes\" Type 2 diabetes is becoming  a world pandemic. We know the consumption  of eggs is related to the development of some  other chronic diseases... what about diabetes? Researchers found a stepwise  increase in risk the more and more  eggs people ate. Eating just a single  egg a week appeared to increase the odds  of diabetes by 76%. Two eggs a week appeared  to double the odds, and just a single egg  a day tripled the odds. Three times greater  risk of type 2 diabetes, one of the leading causes  of death and amputation, blindness, and kidney failure. This is not the  first time a link between eggs and diabetes  has been reported. In 2009, Harvard researchers found  that a single egg a day or more was associated with  an increased risk of type 2 diabetes  in men and women, and that finding has since  also been confirmed in other populations:  Asia in 2011 and Europe in 2012. And the \"high\" consumption of eggs associated with diabetes risk  was less than one a day, though it appears you  have to start early— once you get into your 70s  avoiding eggs may not help. Once we then have diabetes,  eggs may hasten our death. Eating one egg  a day or more appears to shorten  anyone\\'s lifespan, but may double the  all-cause mortality for those with diabetes. Not good news for  the egg industry. From a transcript  of a closed meeting I got through the Freedom  of Information Act: \"Given the rate at which obesity  and incidence of type II diabetes is growing in the US, any association between dietary  cholesterol and type II diabetes could be a \\'showstopper\\'  that could overshadow the positive attributes (of) eggs.”', metadata={'date': '2013-12-09', 'description': 'Even just a single egg a week may increase the risk of diabetes, the leading cause of lower-limb amputations, kidney failure, and new cases of blindness.\\n\\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.
