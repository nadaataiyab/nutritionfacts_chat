For example, a man following the Atkins Diet developed severe cardiovascular issues and erectile dysfunction after starting the diet. His health improved only after switching to a low-fat diet rich in vegetables, grains, and beans.   \n","2                                         Good sources of fiber for managing diverticulosis include large platefuls of leafy vegetables, whole grains, and legumes.

This is due to the low levels of cholesterol and saturated fats in plant-based foods compared to diets containing meat and dairy products.   \n","4                                                      Vitamin B12 deficiency, common in strict vegetarians who don't supplement, can lead to high homocysteine levels, which may increase the risk of both heart disease and stroke. Supplementing with B12 can help maintain healthy homocysteine levels, reducing these risks.   \n","5                                                             Fiber plays a crucial role in preventing diverticulosis by softening the stool and reducing the pressures needed to move stool through the intestines. This helps prevent the formation of diverticula by reducing the strain and pressure on the intestinal walls.   \n","6           High calorie density foods, such as those high in fats and sugars, contribute to obesity as they provide more calories per bite, which can lead to overeating.

In fact, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that individuals with diverticulosis who ate nuts had lower rates of inflammation.   \n","10                                                                   A century ago, diverticulosis was almost unknown, with only 25 cases reported. The increase in cases over time is linked to dietary changes, specifically the reduction in fiber intake due to processed foods and increased consumption of meat and sugars.   \n","11                                                Vegan soul food, which includes healthier plant-based alternatives, is increasingly adopted in African American communities.
